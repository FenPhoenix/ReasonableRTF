Mech Angelo

A Thief 2 Fan Mission
By Ricebug
Original release date: November 11, 2010
Re-release date: 5 November 2012


This version of Mech Angelo was re-worked for the New Dark engine, released in September 2012. It takes advantage of high-resolution textures, 32-bit lighting, EAX, and other upgrades.

Known Problems

You can actually enter the town (your final objective) if you don’t finish your objectives. However, the mission won’t end and you’ll get a nasty surprise.

When you walk across the reflective floor in the cathedral, you’ll hear Garrett make a jumping noise. This is a game engine bug. The model’s archetype is the catwalk, which does the same thing.
