PORTISCO HEAD

A Thief 2 FM By Ravenhook
Production Assistant: Freddy Fox


Story so far

This FM takes place after the end of Coalport, where you were surprised to find your old adversaries The Mechanists in control of that lonely outpost. You have done well to get past those fanatics, but now you are confronted by a steel door and have a moment or two to reflect on your troubles.

As you have been "dumped" here by an outraged landlord you have no idea how far away from home you really are.  You don’t know whether to try to return to your home and exact revenge on your ex landlord or to stay in this area. Obviously if you wish to stay here you are going to have to explore this world in detail and take care of any dangers - what should you do?

You opt to explore and restock your wealth, so your first task is to open the door and see what's on the other side....


Objectives

Steal 3000 loot (Normal), 4500 loot (Hard), 6000 loot (Expert).

Find the exit.
(2 more objectives are revealed as play progresses.)


My Thanks

To anyone whose textures or objects seem familiar: this FM was created with the standard Dromed version and I have not knowingly used any custom items. My apologies if Dromed has thrown up anything "sinister".

Gaetane, for the bucket headed archer idea - outstanding.

Everyone at TTLG without whose help this would not be possible.
