Description             : I was drinking with a friend tonight. He had a little too much, and started talking. It turns out he overheard an argument through his apartment window. A group of three second rate nobles stole an ancient coin from one of their richer relatives while they were at a party. They consider this rare and ancient coin their ticket to greener pastures, but they don't trust each other. The coin is being kept in a safe in one house, but the key is in another house, locked in a combination safe. The last noble reset the combination and has it hidden in their house. They are moving the coin through a fence as soon as possible. I've decided to pull this job tonight. I haven't planned for it, and I don't have much equipment with me, but if I wait until tomorrow night, the coin may be gone by then. I'll bring it to my fence, and he'll flip it to another fence. Flipping this coin may come up heads.
