the story:


In the first part of Horns of Canzo, the Brotherhood of Fire informed 
Garrett that they had kidnapped his friend Basso.  Basso's "ransom" 
required Garrett to travel to Italy, then journey to an Italian mountain 
named the Horns of Canzo, near the small village of Canzo.

Garrett's first challenge was to reach room 4 of the infamous Third 
Alp's Inn.  After a bit of trouble, he arrived and took the room.  For 
three long days he lay studying the detailed information given him by 
the Brotherhood. They made their demands quite clear:  Garrett was to 
steal the priceless Dragon's Claw.

The Dragon's Claw artifact is owned by Lord Kanfass; but Garrett learns 
that Kanfass allows his protege, Mario Lombardi, to keep the artifact at 
his beautiful villa.  Lombardi is mayor of Castlebrick, a small clump of 
houses, hardly even a village, surrounded by a security wall.  
Lombardi's villa is just north of Castlebrick, and that is Garrett's 
destination; for there the Claw is locked away in a huge, well-lit, 
heavily guarded room that is watched night and day.

In the third afternoon at the inn, Garrett grabs his weapons and 
thieving equipment and sets out for Lombardi's villa.

Special note:
During the mission you will find a well customized and selfmade texturized Chapel, this is
my personal and modest tribute to the beautyness of many chapels builded in italy 
that are a magnificent witness of the hands of the men guided by the Lord's mind.

Beware: if you don’t like the idea to have a mission pack with the scripts inside BEFORE PLAY, in darkloader press to INSTALL only then go to thief2 folder and delete the files: script.osm thnscript.osm darkhooks.dlx ! after that download from the link down here the scripts modules directly from the original sites.

http://www.thiefmissions.com/scripts/ 

better setting:
audio: channel 16, hardware acceleration=off, eax=off

Construction *
Base       : From mind, then to scratch then forcibly inserted in Dromed with the only help of my patience. (actually, after this experience, I became a Tibetan monk)
Build Time : 2 full and mad/crazy years.. what i said ? 2... not exactly, 2 years of full mad work then other 4 years of discontinuous work on it.. so the result is in 6 years !! SIX DAMNED YEARS omg omg ._.  

NOTE ABOUT THE ANTI-GAS MASK:
in the game you will find a new tool for garrett, it's the AntiGasMask, it works as expected and when you wear it you don't suffer the letal effects of the gas.
Important: to take off the mask you have to select it from your inventory again and click on it. A shortcut key is present, go to the player menu to 
set a Keyboard’s key for select the Antigasmask in a faster way.
Warning: when you wear the mask you cannot use your weapons and if you pick up a weapon, it will disable the Mask.
Same thing if you find a Scouting Orb and use it..


Difficulties differences:
- a couple of secrets (with the pills) are not revealed in hard and expert difficulty.
- the number of the guards increase with the difficulty

know bugs:
- a chandelier in ML villa upper floors sometimes disappear, i don't know the reason.


Music&Sounds:
The song: “the edge of the world” (that substitute the metal1.wav original sound of the thief2 main’s menu) is a whole proudly idea of mine.
The opening classic music in 2nd mission is 'Handel Teseo, Overture'
The party's ancient middle age music is 'Cantiga119'
I used also a sample from Saturnine's excellent mission: the seventh crystal. (with permission)
Thanks also to these contribute from freesounds.org:
thanvannispen - witch laugh
suonho - teleport effect
fectoper - phaedra inspired sound - used in the pills sequence
Zenko - musicalbox
Harri - bass sounds
J.Zazvurek - crickets sounds
reinsamba - forest sounds
elankford - machine sound
