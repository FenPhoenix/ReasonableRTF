----------------------------------------
He was flawed and stumbled
upon the past
But his vigilance would be
his salvation.

Excerpt from The Last Book of The Awakening
----------------------------------------


The city sleeps. A nocturnal breeze blows up and down along the narrow streets of the docks, whistling gently. Garrett has stolen the garmyth, a mysterious gem from the other side of the oceans. Little is known of the garmyth except that it has been gone for a long time and now suddenly reappeared during the most untimely conditions. Whispers and worried glances are exhanged and those few who know of its secrets stand vigilant and pray for salvation. 


It looks like I'll have to visit some old friends.
Tonight's job went well enough but my gut feeling tells me something is not right. Last night I did not have time to stop and ponder but during my long walk there has been plenty of it. With the garmyth in my pocket I've started to hear things. First time was when I grabbed it from that crate and the voices have followed me ever since; haunting me. Time and time again I told myself that it was just my imagination but deep within I knew I acted in denial to cover my worst fears. I need to find out more about this so-called garmyth and learn of its pitfalls. I could just throw it away but then the all the effort would be for nothing and that would be a shame if I'm mistaken. There should be a 'place' just north of here where I can find the information I seek. When I have found what I'm looking for I need to leave the district to the west. The gates are probably locked this time of night so I'll have to procure a key. There should be one in the district warden's office on the top of the large warehouse. I truly hope I'm wrong else I might yet regret the day I embarked on this dire venture.
