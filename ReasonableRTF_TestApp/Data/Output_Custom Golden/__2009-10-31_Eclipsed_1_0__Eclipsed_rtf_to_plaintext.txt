Eclipsed

By: Jeremy Catlin
Release date: October 30th , 2009


****Disclaimer:

 If you have the Thief Enhancement Pack installed a crash may occur, due to the massive use of custom resources.

This mission uses hi-res textures and may have a lower frame rate on older systems. If you are having stutter problems it may be caused by the widescreen patch.



*Introduction

Welcome to Port Aerinth, a small, wealthy, and powerful harbor town. Its inhabitants abandoned it after some still unknown tragedy struck there, but rumor has it that in their terror they left behind their considerable wealth and possessions. While most see this as a tragedy, shake their heads, and get on about their lives, you see an opportunity. An opportunity to plunder without consequence, to finally get the wealth you desire…and deserve, after all these years spent crawling through the shadows.  But strange things occur the moment you set foot in Port Aerinth. It seems that not everyone – or everything – has fled the town. Maybe tonight, the darkness isn’t your friend…
