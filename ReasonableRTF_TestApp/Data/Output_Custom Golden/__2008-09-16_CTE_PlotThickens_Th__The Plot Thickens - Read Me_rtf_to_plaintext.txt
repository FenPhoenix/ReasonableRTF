Title			: The Plot Thickens

Description		: Thief 2 Fan Mission

Story			: The rent is due soon, and the landlord doesn’t accept stolen goblets.  I’m heading off to see a fence tonight to unload some loot.  Farkus Jr.’s shoppe is near the docks in a seedy corner of town, and he’s requested that I come unarmed.  This should be an easy night.

Inspirations		:Act I was inspired by the opening portion of Assassins, I enjoyed following the thieves back to the hideout.  Act II was inspired by Life Of The Party, I enjoyed the roof climbing a lot and wanted to include that aspect.  It also contains some inspiration from Ambush, specifically the city watch in the streets.  Act III was inspired by Kidnap, the Mechanists involved in an archeological dig, they are looking for lost artifacts that may help them in some sinister plot, I enjoy the Garrett as Indiana Jones feeling of that mission.  Act III is also tainted with The Mages Tower, mages and magic, and Life Of The Party again, specifically the necromancer’s tower.

Bugs			: A puzzle in Act III sometimes has triggered without being fully completed.  No idea why, but it hasn’t affected gameplay.  There are Found Secret messages in Act III that come up for no reason.  The secrets total in the mission end stats is correct.  Some testers report a set of fly away doors in Act III.

Tips			: Crates are weapons, they can damage your enemies if you are in a pinch for equipment.  There is a lot of new things to use in Act III, enjoy our new items.
