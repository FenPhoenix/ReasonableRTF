         City Conflict (part1)


Yesterday some hammers were visiting me and made me an offer. I could help them or getting thrown into prison. So guess what, I accepted their offer. They also said that they'll pay good if I manage to do the job.

They said that one of their brothers, called Manus, was ordered to break in the mechanists' embassy and steal some information about the wall, which the mechanists constructed to divide the city into two parts. The embassy has a basement and two floors with some offices and an archive. It's also heavily guarded. The hammers were worried about Manus not showing up for days. They fear that the mechanists caught him, and it's my job to help him escaping.

There's also an old archive down in the basement, but the hammers said that it's locked and the only person who has a key is one of their magicians. It seems that he's the head of the embassy. His office is located in the 2 floor, so I'll have to search there for the key. 

Once I found Manus, I'll have to escape with him through the sewers, which is also the way I'll break into the embassy. I hope that he's still alive to tell his brothers about what he might discovered...
