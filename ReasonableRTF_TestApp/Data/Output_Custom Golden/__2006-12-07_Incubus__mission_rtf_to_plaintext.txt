Important Notes:
There are a couple of .AVI that would be nice to see, 
so to be sure before begin to play (since i experienced some troubles)
reinstall the INDEO CODEC that you can find in the thief2 original cd 
(the 2nd cd), just click on the (seems like a) red box icon.
Be sure also to have Thief2 updated with the official Thief2Patch107-1182
I have a lot of fun creating these little missions, hope you will 
like them…
