 Story:


I have been having dreams lately. Disturbing dreams. Three years ago I did a job on Christmas night at an estate called Snowever, located near a lighthouse. The job ended badly. In addition to not finding a gem that I had been commissioned to steal, I got into a confrontation with the lighthouse keeper, one Brian McHarty. I caused McHarty to fall to his death. This was a mess that my client, Lord Ezio, frowned upon. Word got around, and I was unemployed for a while.
Anyway, that was in the past.  I am over it now. Or am I?  Lately, in my dreams, I have been haunted by McHarty’s ghost. He wants something from me. I am not sure what it is. I think it is revenge.

ITALIAN ONLY:

Storia:


Ho fatto dei sogni, ultimamente. Sogni inquietanti. Tre anni fa, durante la notte di Natale, ho eseguito un lavoro in una tenuta chiamata Snowever, situata nei pressi di un faro. Il lavoro è finito male. In aggiunta al fatto di non aver trovato una gemma che mi era stato commissionato di rubare, ho avuto uno scontro con il guardiano del faro, un certo Brian McHarty. Ho causato la morte di McHarty. Fu un pasticcio che il mio cliente, Lord Ezio, disapprovò. Le voci viaggiarono rapidamente, ed io rimasi senza ingaggi per un po'.

Ad ogni modo, tutto questo fa parte del passato. Sono andato avanti, oramai. Oppure no? Di recente, nei miei sogni, sono perseguitato dal fantasma di McHarty. Egli vuole qualcosa da me... Non sono sicuro di che cosa sia. Credo che voglia vendetta.
