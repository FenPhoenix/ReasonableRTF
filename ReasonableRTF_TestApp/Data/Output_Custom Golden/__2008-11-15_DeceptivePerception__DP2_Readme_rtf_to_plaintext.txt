Deceptive Perception 2: Phantasmagoria
Original Concept by William the Taffer
Completed by Yandros

A Halloween Fan Mission for Thief 2

Released: Nov 14 2008
Version: 1.00

This is the spiritual sequel to Will’s 2002 FM Deceptive Perception, which came in second place overall in Komag’s Contest 3.
In some ways it is a full-sized remake, but in other ways it is much, much more than that.


Story
You've met your old friend Willick at the Rotting Carcass for a pint and some light discussion, when talk turns to your recent adventure trying to recover an artifact from the upper floor of an abandoned Mechanist warehouse that's supposedly haunted.  You don't really want to relive that terrible night just for his entertainment, but he insists on hearing the story, so you throw back some beer and begin.


Known Bugs:
Occasionally, stange noises, usually haunt or zombie voices, start playing unexpectedly.  True, this happens intentionally at times in this mission, but if the voices are “in your head” and keep following you around, it's a bug and you should reload unless you want to hear them for the rest of the mission.
Less frequently, an AI will have a long pause in a conversation.  Usually they'll start again within 10 seconds or so, but if they seem to have stopped permanently, you may need to reload from your last save.  There are many conversations in the mission and every once in a while something will just not work properly.

If you see your own work in this mission and it’s uncredited, please contact me (Yandros) and I’ll update this readme.  I inherited the mission from Will and didn’t know the source of everything, so I attributed most of the resources which were unknown to him.
