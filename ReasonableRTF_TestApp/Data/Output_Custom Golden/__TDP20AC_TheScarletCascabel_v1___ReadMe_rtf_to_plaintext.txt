The Scarlet Cascabel
Thief: Dark Project 20th Anniversary Contest Submission

Requires NewDark 1.26  
Authors: PukeyBrunster and Tannar
Release date:  30th November 2018

STORY:

It's about time I visited an old friend of mine.

I received a letter from Wendolyn, who used to run with Basso and me back in the old days.  She's been lying low for last few years, running a modest operation near the borders of Wychwood.

She has reason to believe a famed artifact can be found there, and not just your average, dusty relic.    

It's a long road through Wychwood. Superstition prevails that the woods are evil, filled with devils and spooks.. you know, the usual.  But I could use some quiet time in the country for a change, and deep woods have plenty of shadows for me to feel.. at home in.

DIFFICULTY: 
Normal: Fewer AI, more equipment to be found in mission, easier route to important area.
Hard: Fewer AI, more equipment to be found in mission, easier route to important area.
Expert: More AI, sometimes need to look for alternate route into areas, less equipment in mission

KNOWN ISSUES:
Can't knock out sleeping AI, but they don't wake up so this won't disrupt gameplay.  One or two AI like to hop on the tabletops.  Certain inventory items, if dropped and again picked up, will repeat the same ambient hit when originally frobbed to inventory.  The 'New Objective' on readables begins to play a bit before the readable is read.  Certain spinning textures, if viewed from an angle, may seem to disappear.

SPECIAL THANKS TO:
First and foremost we'd like to thank Russ Robins (Yandros) for his tireless efforts to get the technical aspects working and polished. He provided endless advice and support as well as constant encouragement.  He was always available to answer questions, and slaved over this with as much passion as we had.  This wouldn't be what it is without him.

An huge thank you to our testers who all went above and beyond under a severe time constraint to be sure the mission was as bug free as possible.  Marbleman and DarkMax especially gave till they bled.

Thanks to Nickie for correcting our texts, as usual.

Thanks to Andros the Oxen and Leigh Catlin for stepping in at the last minute and delivering superlative voice lines.  They truly brought our main characters to life.  

We truly could not have done it without any of you, and you have our heartfelt thanks and appreciation.
