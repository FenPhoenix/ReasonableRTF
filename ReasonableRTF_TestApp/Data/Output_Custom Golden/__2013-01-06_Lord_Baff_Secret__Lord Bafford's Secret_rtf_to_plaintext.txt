* Construction *
Base: From Miss2.mis  Thief Gold  Some multibrushes from other sources, including from Redface.  Made originally for the Thief Reloaded Contest 3
Known Bugs: Sometimes the ai will get stuck in the lower Bafford Towers.  Reload fixes it.  This mission is ghostable, as long as an objective is optional.
This mission will never be revised by me. Failing eyesight has forced me to quit using computers forever.  I am now just a Taffer, Tapping around.
Some of my local friends are assisting me when needed.  I have purchased Dragon Speak version 11, which when learned I will use it when I can.


===================================================================================
===================================================================================
Story:Lord Bafford inherits a gift-a mechanist servant.  A few months later, the town is stirred with rumors of Lord Bafford's extreme wealth, and more importantly,  Where did he get it?
A violent gang of thieves and  thugs abducted Lord Bafford's Servant, and girlf friend with extorsion in mind.  They will  stop at nothing to extort Bafford's secret to wealth.  Lord Bafford has beefed up security, as he plans on keeping his tremendous fortune.  Maybe his throne room will be of actual use to him someday ?  His eventual plan is to buy the city, and then the surrounding territories.  With wealth comes problems, and of course corruption.  With great wealth comes the burden of keeping it.  I have no problem with helping him to lose it.

 A city watchman caught me pinching a key, and I was thrown in jail.  No problem, I will just escape and find out what secrets Lord Bafford is keeping. Sometimes rumors can be valuable.
 Lord Bafford usually keeps journals, and probably has a book of secrets somewhere.  Hopefully I can find it before the local thieves do.  Maybe in his bedroom, or perhaps in one of his many   counting rooms ?  Time to get going, as even rich men like Lord Bafford can lose all that he holds dear to him in just one night.

The idea behind the story: This being based on the first mission in the Dark Project, was also my first love.  At the end of all things since "Return to Bafford Manor" TG, I close my fm hobby.
As soon as I can say, I am blind, but can see, I will return to this hobby someday, or maybe not.   Long Live Thief !  My plan just a few months ago was to revise all 16 of my fms using New Dark, but the dream has been lost.  I sincerely thank everyone in TTLG, and Shalebridge Cradle, and Thiefmissions, and Brethren at SouthQuarter for their devotion to a game I have loved for years.  Now you see me, now you dont would have made a great story, but the later has come.  Good bye everyone !

Technical Information: Script used: NvScript.osm-included in the zip. Has been made using New Dark engine for Thief 2.  Some problems will eventually be repaired, but not by me.
UnKnown Issues:  Has not been tested on Windows98, or Windows2000. Some reported problems: sometimes the player will get stuck on an object, but usually there is a way to unstuck
yourself. Sometimes sound doesn't work.  I have kept the nostalgiac feel to this classic original, as this was my first love of thief the dark project. The story has been changed, and some texture changes to suit me.  It may not suit everyone, but they are free to edit their own, as this is the original concept of fan missions.  Make it the way you want it, and then share it !
The original Bear Conversation and Basement Conversation have been preserved. Some additonal buildings have been made, along with more ai in the mission to complete the new story.

Bald darauf hat eine Bande gewaltbereiter Verbrecher seine Dienerin entführt. Sie wollen Bafford erpressen seine Geheimnisse preiszugeben. Der stockt sein Wachpersonal auf, um weiter ungestört seinen Geschäften nachgehen zu können.
Mich hat man derweil aufgegriffen und in den Knast gesteckt. Daraus werde ich wieder verduften, um Baffords Geheimnisse ergründen zu können. Für gewöhnlich notiert er all seine Geheimnisse, doch wo? Im Schlafzimmer oder in einem seiner Geldzähl-Räume?
