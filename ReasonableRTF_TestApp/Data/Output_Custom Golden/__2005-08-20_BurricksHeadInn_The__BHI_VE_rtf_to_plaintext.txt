The Burrick’s Head Inn: Vintage Edition

Original Private Release:  11/05/04
Subsequent Public Release:  08/20/05

1. This is a re-release of v2.0, but everything is in an old-fashioned
sepia tone.  The artwork and music have been changed accordingly
to suit the time period (early 20th Century).

2. The large Easter Egg area is gone.  In its place is a very small one.
The way in has changed, so have fun finding it.

3. I adjusted some of the sound files to make the mission load faster
and waste less disk space.

Author		Yandros (Russ Robbins)
Date of release	Original Release – 01/25/03 (Contest 4 submission)

=============================================================
Version 2.0 Changes
Expanded several areas, including the lobby, basement and penthouse.
Various bug fixes and tweaks (see below in spoilers section if you want
details).  Lobby music can now be switched off for those who find it
annoying, and some music has been changed.  Also made the level more
easily translatable by moving all object names to the objnames.str file.
Added a large (relatively speaking) easter egg and a few new AI.

Description

As usual, the rent is due... but this time I also owe a few
shopkeepers for some equipment I had to buy on credit, so I'd
better go for a bigger haul than usual.  There's a rustic little inn
I've hit a couple of times before called The Burrick's Head.
The decor is upscale, so there should be plenty of trinkets and
valuables lying about... not to mention what the guests bring
with them, which should be significant since the inn caters to
the nobility.

As an added bonus, the papers the other day mentioned a noble
lady staying there who had just inherited a fortune.  Seems the
estate includes a gigantic sapphire called The Angel's Tear.  I'm
sure it's safely tucked away somewhere, but if the opportunity
presents itself, I'll have to go for it.  According to the news story
it's insured for 50,000 crowns, so it would mean I could take a
few years off thieving and actually enjoy life for a while.  That
is, if Cutty can find a buyer for such a well-known valuable.
But then, that's never been much of a problem for him before...

file, but put the whole "BHInn.zip" file into whatever folder/directory
you want to on your hard drive, then in Darkloader setup, point to this
folder/directory, and the mission should show up in the Darkloader
main screen.


=============================================================
Known Problems:

For some reason, attaching to the rope can be tricky.  I have had the
best success by looking up and holding the up button (to start climbing)
while jumping onto it.  I guess if you have your setting to attach
by walking instead of jumping you might not have this problem.
v2.0:  This has been improved significantly by making the balconies
wider and moving the rope further out from the wall.

I highly recommend NOT jumping off the rope onto the lower penthouse
balcony.  I've taken measures to try to prevent it from being possible,
but if you manage to make it there you'll probably be stuck since the
door doesn't open and you can't jump over the railing once you're on
the balcony.
v2.0:  Feel free to do this if you want; the door is still locked, but the
balconies are all climbable if you want to run the risk of falling.

=============================================================
Fixes & Changes for v2.0

Many areas have been expanded now that the contest and its space
restrictions are over – notably, the basement, lobby, courtyard and
penthouse.  Basement expansion includes preventing the player from
either knocking out Ravik or following him into the sewer area
prematurely.

Made the music purely classical (well, technically most of it is from
the Romantic period), with the exception of the two ambient loops and
Geoff’s ethnic record.  Added incidental music while reading, a BIG
thanks to Gumdrop for showing me how (in Thief Noir)!

The music in the lobby now comes from a speaker on the wall which can
be turned off with a wall switch by the bar.

Fixed penthouse balcony door problem.  Thanks Hit Deity!

Hopefully made the rope appear more reliably.  By expanding all the
balconies, the rope is now much easier to attach to.  Thanks to
Bumbleson for suggesting this.



=============================================================
Designer's Note

The final battle's (you'll know it when you get there) combatants
have been tweaked so that they each have as close to a 50/50 chance
of winning the fight as possible.  This is my attempt at adding a
small degree of randomness to the mission as well as enhance the
replayability a little bit.  I don't know if the battle's outcome
will really affect how you finish playing out the mission, but at
least maybe it makes it a little more interesting.

Adjustment for v2.0:
The balance has been shifted so that one of the parties wins most of the
time.  I need her alive and well so she can appear in future FM’s.  ☺
