§ Description §
My first mission, originally made for Thief Gold,
now transformed into a Thief 2 mission.

§ Story §
Four months ago a noticeable cache of silver disappeared from
the City Bank. Your suspicions lead you to Lord Alan, who
belongs to the Thieves Guild. He loves music and has a court
musician: Maestro Andreas. You have obtained a map of Lord
Alan's Basement and by all appearances, the cache is somewhere
in there ... and probably something more.
