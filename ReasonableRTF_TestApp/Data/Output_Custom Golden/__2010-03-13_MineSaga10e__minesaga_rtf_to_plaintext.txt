Description:
	Mine Saga begins at Darkstone Mine, a completely dark mission 
in which you have to use flares to navigate and light torches while
trying to complete your objectives. The next mission, Mine Affairs,
brings you to a small manor in the city that hides a mournful secret.
Bonds of Mine takes you to the northern mountains through a garrison,
a Hammerite Monastery with a dark past and an ancient mage's tower.
The last mission, Mine Saga's End, is set back in the city.
	For additional improved graphics, I recommend downloading and 
installing the Thief Enhancement Pack by Nameless Voice, unless you
prefer a more classic look.

Author's Note:
	Mine Saga is a compilation of all my previously released 
missions, updated with better graphics, visuals, enhancements to 
gameplay and many additions, changes, and improvements that I couldn't 
possibly list. Mine Saga also includes a brand new unreleased mission, 
briefings for each mission and an ending credits movie.
	Darkstone Mine was originally created in just a weekend, and was 
intended to take an element of gameplay, flares, and use them to their 
utmost potential. As a consequence, the entire mission has zero ambient 
light and is contained in the space of a 64 foot cube.
	Mine Affairs was released just a week after Darkstone Mine was
released. It was originally intended to be in a 64 foot cube, but was
rearranged to better utilize space and fits in a 64x128x32 foot brush, 
with the same volume.
	With Bonds of Mine, I tried to create a large organic feeling 
outside environment using textures I personally made. Construction
took several months. It's the only mission in the campaign that wasn't
intended to fit in a 64 foot cube.
	Mine Saga's End is also a genuinely small mission that was
originally intended to be inside a 64 foot cube, but was just slightly
expanded for an very special effect and added visuals.
	I certainly hope you enjoy the missions, but most of all I hope I 
get you thinking about some of the ideas and themes that are presented 
through the story. It was those ideas that fueled the creation of all
my missions.

Thanks for playing!
