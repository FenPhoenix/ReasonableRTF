Description:

Come one, come all!  Test your archery, test your melee skills!
Face the invincible guard!  Go down and take whatever equipment
you want!  Keep your archery skills sharp with target practice!

Ok, basically, this is a little mission cobbled together in about 2
hours, mostly to keep your archery skills sharp and work on your
melee combat.  The equipment room is past to the left, at the
forward end of the room, down the water shaft, and has 35 fire,
vine, and water arrows, and a sword.  The melee training room
is to your right, but be careful, the guard can and will kill you if
you give him the opportunity.  You start out with a set of 100
broadheads to practice with, and there are no objectives, just
practice.  ^_^

This mission was not made, nor is supported in any way, by Looking Glass Studios (RIP) or Eidos Interactive.

Thanks to Komag for his awesome tuts, menus, and whatnot.
