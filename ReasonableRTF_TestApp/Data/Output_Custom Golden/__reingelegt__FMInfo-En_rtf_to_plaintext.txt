Story:

I was about to go to sleep when I suddenly heard somebody knocking at my door, followed by the noise of running feet. Seems they left a letter under my door  ...

Description:

Linear or not, it is recommended to fulfil the main task of the mission first. Some items and additional goals, which are essential to advance the story, will appear later ... it doesn't make sense to look for clues or loot before then.

The Expert level has additional requirements which are not visible at the beginning, and will appear in a later phase of the game. For those who don't like surprises, Normal or Hard might be the preferred choice.

The candle flames can be "blown out". Be careful, guards wearing helmets can't be knocked out (isn't that more realistic?). Remember the OMs, don't forget that vine arrows work not just on wooden surfaces, and never save during a conversation ...

I do not recommend the use of either texture mods or subtitles.
