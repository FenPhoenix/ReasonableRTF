Story

Whilst spending a weekend with Aunt Agatha, Gussie Fink-Nottle has fallen head over 
heels in love with the fey Madeline Bassett. However, Bertie Wooster is also staying 
with the aging relative and Gussie is highly suspicious of Bertie’s motives since  until
 very recently Bertie and Madeline were engaged to be married. 

The household has now retired to bed but despite Anatole’s best efforts Gussie is 
having a bad night and is embroiled in a worrysome dream…

Playing Tips (And Apologies):

Difficulty Level:   It is always problematic setting the difficulty level in a mission,
especially as I wanted to make this a challenge. I hope players do not find it too 
frustating and persevere. By the time I had an opportunity to beta-test the mission 
I was sick to death of it and could not bring myself to make any major changes so 
I’m afraid it will remain as it is warts and all. My best advice is to save often!
Apologies to those who find the level frustrating.

Jumps:   Some of the jumps in the mission are pretty nasty, but they are all needless 
to say possible. Keeping your finger on the forward button seems to sometimes help
Gussie gain purchase. If you keep failing then maybe a new tack is required.
Apologies for this.

Bouncy Ropes:   You may encounter “bouncy rope” syndrome during the misssion. I
know Idid (and my keyboard bears the scars). There is no known cure for this, however
keeping your finger on the forward button sometimes seems to help you gain purchase.
Blame Thief for this one.
N.B You can save suspended on a rope arrow but may need to press forward to stay on
it as the level reloads. 

Moving Platforms:   Moving platforms feature in this level and can be a mite tricky. Ensure
that you are on them before saving or attempting to jump from them. If you do not hear a
satisfying metallic sound when you land on one then I recommend you try again, especially 
if you need to jump any distance from it. The best time to jump from a moving platform is in
the split second it changes direction. If you jump while it is moving Gussie has the same
forward momentum that the platform does which usually results in a nasty fall and a painful
death. 
I blame Thief for this one too.

Undead:   I hate undead (and would never include them without adequate means to dispatch
them in a totally gratuitous fashion – that is a hint).

Objectives:   The idiot who designed this level forgot to give the player the ability to move 
back and forth between areas. Thus once you have left an area by fulfilling the main 
objective there is no way back. To prevent PC’s being hurled out of windows in frustation 
I have made the extra objectives on the two harder difficulty setiings optional. I am abject.

Secrets:   The secrets in this level might be a little tricky to find. I have tried to place little
clues as to their location in each applicable area. Remember that everything has a purpose.
I am still abject.

End:   The mission does end correctly……. Oh yes it does!

Gamma Setting:   For best results play this mission in the dark with th gamma set just below
half way.

Picked Pocket Count WTF?:   Don’t ask me. Me no understandy either.
