"Iron Heart" 

Story

It has been a long time since I heard about mystical objects and great treasures. I am getting tired of robbing the same banks and cities over and over. Besides, those "magical" objects are incredibly prized by eccentric collectors. There is a mansion in a secluded valley far away from the city; the former owner has died recently and a certain Stalkreath has bought it. The former owner was a rich and solitary man with peculiar tastes in terms of art. Word has it that a tremendous treasure is buried under the mansion, within a city that sank in olden days. While there is no proof whatsoever that a city is somewhere down there, it is certain that the man had a lot of unique items when he was still alive. The rumour talks about an ancestral kingdom that sank because of its megalomaniac ruler who wished for a city made out of iron. This ruler was often represented by a crown, a large red "gem"-shaped iron nugget, and an iron mask. All of these are undoubtedly extremely valuable to someone out there, and they are probably of no use to a city of dead fellows. I had better snatch them and make my way back to the surface, if such a place truly even exists.

Note: 
This is my first FM ever released. It will obviously have gameplay issues and won't have the same quality as other FMs since I am not the greatest Thief player, so be indulgent. This was done under the 1.23 version of NewDark (at least I do believe it was). I recommend that you often save (not only through quicksave) since the level has a lot of hazardous places and a lot of objects using properties that are not theirs.
{Also, you may want to check out the preview trailer of this FM before you play it, just in case you'd miss something in there}
