Discription.                         
                        : It's Christmas Eve, but all is not well. The people of a
                          nearby village have had their christmas presents stolen,
                          and you have been hired by them to get their presents back.
                          Yes, this is completely different to what you normally do, but
                          hey, it's Christmas, so just for once it's time to give back,
                          rather than take.
                          It's time to play Santa Claus taffers,....oooohh yeah.

	            : Of course this FM is just a bit of fun,... so don't take the
                          story too seriously. Have fun and Merry Christmas.
