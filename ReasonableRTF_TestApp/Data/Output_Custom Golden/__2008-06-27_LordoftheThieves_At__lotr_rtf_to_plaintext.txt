Mission Briefing	:

 Last night I got a letter from the Keepers: 

Garrett, 

We need your help again. Yesterday evening an army of orcs sieged and took the city of Nahoras. We think this was the first step of a master plan, but we do not know exactly what it is. We fear that they are about to launch an assault on every city and village. It is very important to find out what they want, and that is why we need your skills. You must infiltrate the orc-occupied town and find out something about their plans. 
One more thing: there is an ancient sword somewhere in the sieged city, named 'The Flame of the North'. It was once King Elendur's sword, but it is now shattered and has lost its power. Nevertheless, it's still a very valuable sword. 
We will tell you more about it when you return. Unfortunately, it is locked in a tower and the key is nowhere to be found. We suspect the gatekeeper was trapped in the sealed mine. So get inside there and keep your eyes open but be extra careful, that place was sealed for a reason. 
I know that you would reject this quest, but please consider it, if we don't stop the orcs they will wipe us out from this world. 

Keeper E. 

I hate the jobs given by the Keepers, but this sounds serious. I think I should pay a visit to Nahoras...
