Instructions

	Place .zip file in preferred directory for Darkloader to open. Do not unzip unless you wish to install manually. Darkloader 4.3 recommended. NVScript 1.2.2 and tnhScript 2.1 (included) are highly recommended for play. 

Background

	Some time has passed since Garrett sabotaged Karras's plans to destroy all life. The loss of their leader and the revealed fanaticism of their faith have caused Mechanists to fall out of favor, allowing the Hammerite faith to rise again. As many Mechanists convert or flee, there are less people to maintain the many complicated security devices around the City. The existence of the Mechanists is being slowly wiped away in the ensuing chaos.

	Garrett has been mostly keeping to himself after the incident at Soulforge, resting and so far living on the lucre acquired during his partnership with Viktoria. Now, his funds have once more run dry and he is forced to take to thieving again to support himself. It seems like all of Garrett's efforts to save the City from Constantine and Karras were ultimately pointless when he is again forced to scrounge for coins just to keep his landlord happy and his belly full.

	During this needy time, a nobleman, Lord Rein von Krane, has contacted Garrett wishing to hire his expert services. It may not be a choice job, but it's a job.
