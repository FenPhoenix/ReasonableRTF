* Story *
It is time for a peaceful and serene holiday, and my place of choice is Saint Moria.  It’s situated among quiet meadows high in the mountains with nothing but the sound of birds singing, fresh air, and peace and quiet away from the city.  No City Watch, but the Hammerites have an interesting community there which is right in my ball game.  According to some old Hammerite documents I picked up from my fence in exchange for a small silver nugget, there’s a compound the Hammerites have built to provide a serene place to bury their own. The map shows a huge underground crypt and, from where the map is torn, it looks like another area having some ancient symbols. I am sure the Hammerites there will have some information on it, but if not, I should be able to dig something up.

My fence also spoke of a Rare Bird Book in St. Moria.  It seems the High priest finds serenity and peace in raising rare and exotic birds; one in particular, a Cuckoo bird.  The fence also asked to be first in appraising the Rare Bird Book.  He guarantees a high price for it.  He mainly spoke of the Cuckoo bird. It may just be that the High Priest is a little cuckoo.  Rumor has it he speaks in riddles and uses birds in his own life philosophy.  This may be interesting!  A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush!

Like I always say, why not relax and enjoy the mountain air and pile up some loot. The rent is always due and times are getting expensive.  Getting away from the noise and confusion of society may just be my ticket to some place better. The compound will no doubt be heavily guarded, as these crypts usually hold some nice gold artifacts. As usual, I will try to make myself invisible. Get in, and get out in one piece. Off to my holiday!
