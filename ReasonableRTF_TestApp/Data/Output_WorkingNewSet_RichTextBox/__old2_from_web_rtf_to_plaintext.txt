2000 Adoption report  Samuel H. Gruber :

This year we tagged lemon sharks at three nurseries in the western Atlantic.  In March we traveled down to Brazil and boarded the R/V Seward Johnson for our second expedition to Atol das Rocas, amazing atoll in the S Atlantic, just 3 degrees below the equator.  For details of the expedition with photographs and text, please log on to http://www.at-sea.org/missions/sharks/030300/dispatch.html.  During this trip we successfully tagged 46 baby lemon sharks in this unique isolated and most southerly nursery.  The previous year we had caught 14 babies but curiously we did not recapture even a single one in 2000. We believe that life in this outpost nursery is harsh and survival is low.  We plan trips in September and February 2001 to see what happened to our little tagged charges.

Our second project was a continuation of the overall study begun in 1995.  The 1999 project was featured on the Discovery channel program “Quest,” a series about a big blue research vessel traveling the Caribbean in search or research adventure (see http://www.discovery.com/exp/quest/bahamas.html  ).  For the 6th consecutive year we censused the newborn cohort of lemon sharks and their older conspecifics capturing 203 juveniles from new born to 3 years old.  As usual, most of the older shark carried our electronic identity tags.  This differs greatly from our recapture rate at Atol das Rocas and the Marquesas (see below).

In three days we will leave for the Marquesas Keys SW of Key West aboard the R/V Seadiver for our 3rd lemon shark census in Marquesas lagoon (please see http://www.at-sea.org/features/gruber0199.html). In each of the previous expeditions of 1998 and 1999 we captured about 60 young lemon sharks.  Again we were surprised to recapture only a single shark in 1999.  However, we now believe that the sharks grow much more rapidly at the Marquesas than at Bimini and this year we will use heavier nets and rod and reel to try to recapture at least some of the 120 sharks tagged between 1998 and the present.

As for our adopted sharks:  We have not heard from Iago or Mama since 1998.  By this time Iago, a male is mature and may not return to Bimini.  Mama may have returned this year if she survived the longline hooks and other dangers but we didn’t see her.  Yet we will be able to tell if she gave birth at Bimini when we perfect our genetic analyses.  

Two of our baby shark adoptees were seen again this year:  Freedom, one of Mama’s babies born on born at 15:05 (3:05pm) on April 16, 1998 was recaptured on June 7, 1998 and again this year on May 21, 2000.  She had grown from 60 cm and 1.9 kg to 75.8 cm and 2.9 kg over the 2-year period.  This is the only shark that I am aware of that data exists from the day she was born to the present!

Another shark we named Tiny was first captured on May 25, 1998 and weightd in at 1.3 kg.  Tiny was recaptured on May 25, 1999 and again on May 21, 2000.  He had grown  from 61.9 cm to 79.3 cm in the two-year period.
