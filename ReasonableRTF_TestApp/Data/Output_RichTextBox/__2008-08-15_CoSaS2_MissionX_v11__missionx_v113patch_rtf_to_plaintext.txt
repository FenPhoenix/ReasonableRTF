PATCHED ITEMS

Major Fixes

• The player will no longer begin in the black box under any conditions, even if they are missing script files.

The black box was put in place to make sure that players who have a faulty T2 install will not be able to play until they’ve corrected the problem.  However with widespread use, it was shown that it was far more likely for the scripts involved to malfunction than it was for the installation to actually be bad.  Thus this safeguard was removed.

• Added a renamed gen.osm (i.e. MXgen.osm) to solve the problem of the bad gen.osm file out there.

Some versions of Thief 2 were shipped with a bad gen.osm file, and this bad file would render MX unplayable (but would, ironically, not be caught by the black box safeguard.)

• Redunancies have been put in place to ensure that if any of the main-plot related timing scripts fail, a backup will be brought into play in order to allow the mission to move forward.

It is believed that saving and loading the game at the precise right time in relation to the function of timed relay scripts would cause the relay to break and disallow the plot to continue.  Extensive and thorough safeguards and redundancies have been put in place to ensure that should this happen, and there’s no way we can make it never happen, other scripting objects would be triggered to take over, allowing the mission to continue with only a minor – and maybe unnoticeable – break.  The lion’s share of the work done on the patch involved creating these backup systems.

• AI issues with broken patrols and the inability to move or flee where they should which were caused by the keychain have been resolved. This includes 1 AI on the top floor (executive), 2 on the 3rd (guards), 3 on the 2nd (2 guards, one executive), and 4 on the 1st (3 servants and 1 executive).*

This was caused by a problem with the keychain – Once the player has a key, all the AIs who also have that key (and AIs need keys to open locked doors just like the player does) would find their patrol paths impossible to complete, because the keys would become no longer useable.  This is why many guards could be seen standing in place, eternally.  Multiple solutions were employed to solve these broken patrols on a case by case basis.  Many doors previously unlockable by the hotel service key are now only pickable.

• The Messenger will no longer drop the scroll case until after he is on the ground.

This note is a spoiler.  Attacking Raputo’s messenger would cause him to drop his scroll case.  If the player then escaped without killing or knocking out the messenger, he would continue on his path until he eventually generated a new scroll case, and potentially a scroll inside, causing a duplicate.  Now the messenger will only drop the scroll case if he is killed or knocked out.

• Put M-NeverEfficient on execs before they go alert.  This will keep the alarm-ringers from ringing the alarm automatically every time you enter a certain area.

Some players reported the alarm being sounded in distant parts of the casino when they simply crossed over a certain point, even if no AIs were present.  This is caused by the way AIs in the dark engine deactivate once they are outside of a certain range from the player.  It is possible for one of the alarm-ringing executives to go alert when the player is not nearby – by seeing a body for instance – but the player can then go out of range before the alarm ringer completes their action.  Then when the player returns to within range, they resume, ring the alarm, and the mission fails.  Distant AIs ringing the alarm because of discovered bodies can still happen, but it will never be delayed and then triggered in this way.

• The player's loot will no longer spontaniously vanish.  

This bug was not present in the 1.0 release, but rather in one of the early patch builds.  I include it here because it is amusing.  It was caused by a “fix” to another bug – the loot purse of one of Raputo’s guards would sometimes linger out in the courtyard after that guard has left the premises.  The fix involved deleting the purse when the guard was deleted.  However, if the player had already taken the purse, it deleted their entire loot cache along with it.  Isn’t the dark engine fun?

• The bug that resulted in a coin purse floating in mid-air somewhere between the Pearl Hall and the back gate has been fixed.

KNOWN ISSUES
(i.e. The following problems have not been corrected by the patch, and are unlikely to ever be.)

AI/Pathfinding
• Guards can get stuck trying to go through doorways two at a time. This usually resolves after a minute or less.
• In the Clubhouse, the guard that patrols into the blackjack area gets hung up on the edge of a table.
• The servant in the Orchid dining hall sometimes gets stuck on the side buffet.
• The dishwasher in the basement kitchen has been known to get stuck in the sink.
• The cook in the basement kitchen can, when alerted, can get stuck on the corner of the table at the west end.
• The 3rd floor exec gets stuck up on railing in mohagany hall 
• One of the guards in the monarch suite stands on top of a dresser.
• The bartender in the monarch suite can become merged with the bar.

General
• Frame rates are an issue at all bar locations, especially the Pearl Hall.
• Loading a saved game which was saved during the Ivory Hall conversation will result in a badly broken conversation.
• Many ladders can only be disembarked by jumping.
• With some keys the key ring doesn't come to the top of the inventory if it is the first key you've taken. This has no effect on functionality.
• The keys carried by guards in the Clubhouse sometimes float in mid-air only to vanish a moment later. The player is seeing the guard's starting location, and the key resets to its proper place once the guard approaches.
• The game crashes on mission load if custom script path is used.
• Document copying scribble sound sometimes retriggers.
• The carrying icon is placed over the messages from team members when those appear on the screen.
• The zap SFX doesn't play if you try to use a fuse on a live box, but you do take damage.
• If a game is saved and then loaded and saved again during one of Pomok's routines in the switch room, he will repeat that routine every time a saved game is loaded.
• If the player flips the switch to turn the power back on while Pomok is on his way, Pomok will stop in place and not move. Saving the game and reloading will allow him to move again, but also results in the above bug if the game is saved a second time.

Serious but Rare
• At random, on very rare occasions, an arrow (vine, noisemaker, gas?), will either freeze in place or bounce around rather than hit its target. Also, water arrows and gas arrows that won't go off when they hit, and broadhead arrows that can be picked back up once fired. Often loading a saved game will fix this problem. 
• Sometimes on a reload the basement lights turn back on after they've been shorted out. The 'light' does not effect the player's visibility. Consecutive reloads usually fixes the problem.
• Sometimes the mission doesn't fail when Dante dies.
• It is possible to 'trap' or otherwise prevent one of Pomok's replacements from reaching the utility switch room, therefore allowing them to flip the switch back to "On" by telepathy.
• Numerous and bizarre bugs have been reported concerning some combination of scouting orb malfunctions and acquiring a bow. The team has yet to be able to reproduce these bugs. 
• Where the garden ledge passes over some windows, there's a gap that the player can get stuck in (and potentially S.H.A.S.!)
• S.H.A.S. has been known to occur while navigating the ledge in the Upper Ivory Hall.
