Story:

Two years have passed since the fall of the Mechanist order and Karras's death in Soulforge 
Cathedral. The Hammerites have reclaimed the cathedral and restored its former state, turning it
into a place of worship again. Rumor has it that they've sealed off what remained of the 
destroyed Mechanist factory compound and instead restored access to the extensive crypts right
underneath the cathedral.

Overhearing a conversation in the Crippled Burrick Pub between some criminal low-lifes
working for Ruben, I got some vague information that a precious artifact, a gemstone called 
the "Stone of Alarus", was stashed in the crypts beneath Soulforge. I can't risk letting them 
getting their hands on it so I have to move quickly...

Getting into the compound ain't easy as the whole place is locked down at night. Not even their
novices are allowed to roam around after sunset as they are confined to the cathedral building.
However, thanks to Basso's contacts I know a gravedigger possessing the necessary papers to 
enter the compound at night, though he is only admitted to the cemetery behind the cathedral. 
But that's something to start with after all.

Basso bribed the gravedigger and arranged for me a ride inside a coffin right after midnight.
Furthermore, I'm still in possession of a novices' outfit and Basso provided me with a forged
novices' admission letter. So that's my way in.

Once I'm inside I have to scrutinize the place and find out where exactly the "Stone of Alarus" is
hidden. My best shot is playing the innocent novice and not doing anything suspicious while
searching the place. Since the main gate is locked up at night I'll have to bolt through the 
cemetery gate once I've got what I came for. Before leaving though, I have to place some faked 
evidence pointing at Ruben and his men to avoid any attention being drawn to me...

Notes:

This mission has been designed to have a classic Thief OM look. It is highly recommended 
to disable all mods and texture packs so as not to clash with the intended experience.

When using the „Thief Enhancement Pack“ (or similar) you might notice some objects
intersecting other objects or terrain geometry.
