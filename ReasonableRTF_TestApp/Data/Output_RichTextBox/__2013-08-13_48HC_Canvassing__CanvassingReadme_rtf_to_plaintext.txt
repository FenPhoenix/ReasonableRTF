Story
I've always wanted to try my luck at the Langstrom Art Museum, and since I have nothing better to do tonight, I'm going to go slip in later this evening and make off with as much artwork as I can.  The Langstrom is known for its collections of paintings depicting historical events and landscapes, but the most famous collection is the set of portraits which reside in the three-story circular Great Gallery.  I plan to stuff as many canvases into a big sack as I can - but that load means I have to pack light.  I figure with all the tile floors, the best thing to take is a handful of moss arrows, and I'll have to leave everything else behind.  That's okay, though - my sneaking skills can always use a bit of polishing.
