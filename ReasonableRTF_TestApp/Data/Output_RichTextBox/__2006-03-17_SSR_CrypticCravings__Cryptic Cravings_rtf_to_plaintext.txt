				Story

		Times are bad. Your face adorns every wall. Wherever you turn citizens stare, recalling
		but not recognising... quite yet. It's time to move on. Just in the nick of time you escape
		the clutches of the law and escape to a province new and unexplored. Travelling light 
		(just your faithful friend for company) you find slim pickings moving from town to town 
		sleeping rough. Fortunately you still have some connections even this far away from "real"
		civilisation. A local contact has overheard a local band of cutpurses talking about a lost 
		crypt beneath the ruins of an old Hammerite church long abandoned by the Brotherhood.
		Talk of unimagined riches brings a sardonic smile to your face but further research among
		the town's records and local church archives reveals that there may be some truth to the
		rumours. It appears that the crypt was sealed long ago by the Hammerites when a dreadful
		tragedy beset the church. The Hammerites have tried to cover up its existence and all maps
		of its location are long destroyed. However the local Thieves Guild is hot on the trail and has
		located the ruins of the church and it is only a matter of time before they break into the crypt.
		Time to slip into the shadows and steal a march on these country bumpkins.....

	Gameplay Tips:

			1.The strange doughnuts on the crypts are magical seals. These have to be removed afore
			    they can be opened.

			2. I know it's dark. It is meant to be! Look around at the start for a solution.

			3. Resources are tight! Waste 'em and you may get stuck later on. You've been warned!

			4. Save often! Once those haunts get alerted you have no chance!!
	
	5. There are three difficulty levels. On Warrior you start with a sword, on Cutpurse a blackjack
	    and on Ghost (guess what) nada! So have I tested each difficulty level? No! Can you ghost 
	    this mission? Dunno. Don't care! I play it on Cutpurse with my faithful friend and it is fun!!!
