* Story *
It is time for a Peaceful and Serene Holiday, and my place of Choice is Saint Moria.  Situated high in the Mountains with quiet
meadows, and nothing but the song of birds singing, fresh air, and Peace and quiet away from the city.  No City Watch, but the Hammerites have an interesting community there which is right in my ball game.  According to some old Hammerite documents I picked up from my fence in exchange for a small siver nugget, a compound the Hammerites have built to provide a Serene place to bury their own. The map shows a huge underground Crypt, and from where the map is torn, it looks like another area having some ancient symbols. I am sure the Hammerites there will have some information on it, and if not, I should be able to dig something up.

My fence also spoke of Rare Birds in St.Moria.  It seems as though the High priest finds serenity and peace in raising rare and exotic birds, one in particular a Cuckoo bird.  The fence also asked to be first in appraising some of the birds if I can steal them.  He guarantees a high price for them.  He mainly spoke of the Cuckoo Bird. It may just be that the High Priest is alittle cuckoo, as rumor has it he uses birds in his own life philosophy as well as speaking in Riddles.  This may be interesting ! One bird in hand is better than two in a bush ?

Like I always say, why not relax and enjoy the Mountain Air, and pile up some Loot. The Rent is always due, and times are getting expensive.
Getting away from the noise and confusion of Society may just be my ticket to some place better. The Compound will no doubt be heavily guarded, as these Crypts usually hold some nice Gold artifacts. As usual, I will try to make my self invisible. Get in, and get out in one piece. Off to my Holiday !
