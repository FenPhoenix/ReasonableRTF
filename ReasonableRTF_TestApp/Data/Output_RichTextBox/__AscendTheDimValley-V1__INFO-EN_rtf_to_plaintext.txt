-==ASCEND THE DIM VALLEY==-
=============

BRIEFING:
“My fence claims that, after years of searching, some eccentric old coot struck upon a way into Craggenmense, that sunken gash in the mountains up north. The whispers of riches from this ancient crevasse have been around forever, but nobody’s had the faintest idea how to get in until now. This geriatric wants me to make use of his discovery by acquiring The Iron Façade for him.
Following a long stretch of decay after they were abandoned by whatever precursor culture built them, the immense ruins of Craggenmense became home to a tribe of supposedly human squatters. Either they forget how they stumbled their way in, or they found the debris so alluring that they ditched their nomadic lifestyle in favour of propping up their own ramshackle housing in its midst. 
Rumour has it that some parochial power struggle is raging between two clans in this overstuffed fissure, but sourcing reliable information has proven difficult. Craggenmense is legendary, but I’ve only ever seen mention of The Iron Façade in the Keepers’ most profane archives... heh, guess that settles who the old timer is.
I always suspected there’d be some passage above ground. One look at the towering landscape should have put that suspicion to bed. Good news is the cave system dumps me out at the squalor infesting the base of the valley. I’m not likely to stand out amongst the filth.
It’s a chore, but I wouldn’t miss it. Besides the trinket my client wants, there should be enough… material culture lying around to make the arduous trip worth my while.”

 IMPORTANT:
—I recommend you don’t use any graphics mods to play this mission. My choice of textures and objects wasn’t slapdash; many terrain brushes exist only to allow me more granular control over texture alignment and appearance.

GAMEPLAY NOTES (MAY CONTAIN VERY LIGHT SPOILERS)

   —Remember that the lightgem isn’t just dependent on the floor being lit up! If you’re standing on a dark spot, but the wall behind you is in light, Garrett will be lit up by that light source if he goes between the source and the wall!
   —You are not missing any gameplay or content on lower difficulties. Expert has slightly less equipment and slightly fewer guards, but loot is identical for all.
   —There are no invisible enemies.
   —There are no ‘cryptic’ clues in readables. If you can’t pick up a readable, it isn’t required to complete objectives. Most readables are shorter than one page.
   —No keys/loot are hidden under furniture or inside solid objects.
   —There are no micro-switches. Any hidden switches that may or may not exist would be normal size.
   —Some windows can be opened. If you have trouble getting through window frames, trying holding space and/or leaning though them.
   —Try mantling on everything! Doors, signs, lights, trees, windows, walls, balconies, everything. Even torches, if you don’t mind getting hot feet.

TECHNICAL NOTES
 
   —This FM only supports FMSel, AngelLoader, or NewDarkLoader — these can load fm.cfg files.
   —This FM was made using NewDark 1.26. It might be compatible with 1.25, but I would recommend upgrading if only to play the dozens of excellent FMs that actually require 1.26 and newer.
+===+
KNOWN ISSUES
   —the ambient propagation is screwy in a few isolated spots. For these places, none of the variants I tried that avoided gaps in the roombrushing and no sound bleed through walls produced perfect ambient propagation. No doubt a more talented mapper could have achieved it, but alas, you’re stuck with me.
