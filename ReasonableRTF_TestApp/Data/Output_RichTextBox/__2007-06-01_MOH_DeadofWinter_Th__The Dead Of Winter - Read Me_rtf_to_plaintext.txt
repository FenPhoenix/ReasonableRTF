Title			: The Dead Of Winter

Description		: Thief 2 Fan Mission

Story			: With all the chaos in The City after the death of our beloved Father Karras, Brothers Glatzel and Sacco have moved a small band of us to a castle in the mountains far to the north.  Here we intend to complete Father Karras’ greatest design, a dimensional portal.  With this device we shall bring The Builder’s Paradise to the world.  All thy gears shall be lubricated and in good repair when the portal allows The Builder to walk among us.  Join us tonight as we again attempt to operate this greatest design of the immortal Father Karras and bring peace to the world.

Bugs & Tips		: This mission is very resource intensive due to complex and detail architecture.  There are a few instances where objects or AI will disappear on screen because the renderer is over loaded.  Please, if you have a slower rig be warned that this is a problem.  I pushed the engine a little too far in a few places.
Briefing(s)		: No
