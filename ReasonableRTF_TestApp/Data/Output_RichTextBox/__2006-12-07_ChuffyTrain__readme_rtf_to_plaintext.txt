Info: This is for the Dromed's Total Crap FM Competition, being done by Brother Renault. loooooooool!
Author: I can't tell you that just yet! >_<

A train has got stuck inside a tunnel after a rockfall blocking both ends of the tunnel. (It's pretty dark in there now!) You were also aboard the train when this happened, because you were hiding on the top of one of the trucks. You were only there because you needed to get to the next town pretty quicks, but since you are stucked here now, you are pretty madd! Take all you're anger and unleash it upon all those on the train! Muhahahaha! :-)
