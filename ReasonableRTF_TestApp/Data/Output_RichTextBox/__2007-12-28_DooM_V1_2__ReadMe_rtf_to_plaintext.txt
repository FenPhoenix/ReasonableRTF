These are the first two maps of the original DooM, made by iD Software. It was made for Thief II
for a couple of reasons:

1. For us old-timers to remember the good ol’ days. 
2. To re-create a tiny piece of the DooM universe for those who can no longer run the game on the
    newer machines.

The architecture is 99% to scale from the original DooM, although certain liberties were taken to 
accommodate Garrett’s height and abilities (the DooM player was shorter, and he couldn’t jump
or climb). There is no loot, only one readable, and very economic objectives.  Enemies were added
just to maintain interest.
