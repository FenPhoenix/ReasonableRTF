Story:

The money is getting low and it is about time to get back to the black market. Word in the city has it that deep In
the forest there is an old abandoned mansion. In this building there are supposed to be several precious things and,
who knows, maybe there is hidden some sort of rare object. But I don't want to be this adventure to be a long
episode, that's why I'll leave my equipment here, all I'll need is a lantern to lighten the rooms. Well, it's full moon
but better safe than sorry.
Here we go! Garrett, the gold is waiting...
