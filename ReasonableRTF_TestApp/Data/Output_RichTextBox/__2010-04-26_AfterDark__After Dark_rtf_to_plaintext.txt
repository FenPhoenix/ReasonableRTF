You are just a pilferer living in a small old town. This town is very poor, and many its citizens are even poorer.
Once upon a time, your old friend,has contacted with you. He knew what it is to live in your town. He also knew about your “profession”, so he offered you a little job: to find him an antique scroll. Your friend gave you 10 000, so you just cannot say him ‘no’…
