Title			: The Night Shift

Description		: Thief 2 Fan Mission

Story			: A man came to me with a simple job, steal a book, no big deal I thought.  He’s interested in an ancient tome recently uncovered in Karath-Din.  He says its called the Book of Shadows and contains writing in runes no one can understand.  He’s not able to pay much for the job, but the book is on display in a tiny museum in Audale, a good place to find some loose change and maybe a trinket or two.  I hear they have a nice collection of Lost City artifacts, a cultivator might bring a nice price in black alley and the museums safe box should make my rent for a while too.  And while I’m at it getting a look at this book before I hand it over could be useful, if the runes are anything like the Keeper glyphs I might find some useful information in this book.  Looks like tonight I’m working the night shift.

Yandros for hosting this contest, it was great doing things stock for a little while.  Telliamed, Gaylesaver and Nameless Voice for writing the kick ass scripts that run the behind the scenes action.

*Alpha Test*
Sluggs as always, a fine tester to have back in our community.

*Beta Test*
Sluggs, a huge help, I sent him copies of the mission and he tested them all, endless source of new ideas, pointed out all the bugs I’d missed and made this mission a lot better.  Yandros, a big thanks for finding a big old bug that I hadn’t even been able to get to.
