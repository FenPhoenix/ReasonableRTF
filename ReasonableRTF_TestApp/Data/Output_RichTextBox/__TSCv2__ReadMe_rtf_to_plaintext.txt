STORY:

It's about time I visited an old friend of mine.

I received a letter from Wendolyn who used to run with Basso and me back in the old days.  She's been lying low for the past few years, running a modest operation near the borders of Wychwood.

She has reason to believe a famed artifact can be found there, and not just your average, dusty relic.    

It's a long road through Wychwood. Superstition prevails that the woods are evil, filled with devils and spooks... you know, the usual.  But I could use some quiet time in the country for a change, and the deep woods have plenty of shadows for me to feel... at home in.

KNOWN ISSUES:
DO NOT PLAY WITH MODS INSTALLED!  Playing this mission with mods installed may make it extremely difficult to navigate parts of the mission.
Some effects, if viewed from a certain angle, may seem to disappear. Despite our best efforts, some AI may occasionally behave strangely. You may find one or two spots where mantling is difficult or impossible, but in each case you can get up to the same place in other ways. The final objective in Mission 2 may be missing the green checkmark in the objectives screen when completed, but the mission will still end.

DIFFICULTY: 
Normal: Fewer AI, more equipment.
Hard: Fewer AI, more equipment.
Expert: More AI, less equipment.

SPECIAL THANKS TO:
First and foremost we'd like to thank Yandros for his tireless efforts to get many of the technical aspects working and polished. He provided endless advice and support as well as constant encouragement.  He was always available to answer questions, and slaved over this with as much passion as we had.  This wouldn't be what it is without him.

A huge thank you to our testers who all went above and beyond to be sure the mission was as bug free as possible.  Marbleman and DarkMax gave till they bled, especially under a severe time constraint for the original release.

A special thank you to skacky for making this contest happen. His encouragement to the community and his passion for the anniversary contest made it a huge success. He inspired many authors, old and new, and we felt honored to be a part of it.

Thanks to Nickie for correcting our texts, as usual.

Thanks to Andros the Oxen and Leigh Catlin for stepping in at the last minute and delivering superlative voice lines.  They truly brought our main characters to life.  

We could not have done it without any of you, and you have our heartfelt thanks and appreciation.

Additional thanks to FenPhoenix, Minin, and The Count for publishing Let's Plays of our original contest entry.  They were a great help in identifying bugs and seeing our mission through the players' eyes.
