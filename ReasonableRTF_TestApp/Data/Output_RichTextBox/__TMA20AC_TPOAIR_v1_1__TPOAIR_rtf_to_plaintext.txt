THIS FM CAMPAIGN REQUIRES THIEF 2 TO BE PATCHED TO AT LEAST V.1.27

PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY ENHANCEMENT PACKS:
This FM campaign has the vanilla textures’ design in mind.  Having enhancement packs could present undesired results unless those packs stayed true to the geometry of the design.  (ex: compare fig. 1&2.)

Fig. 1 Vanilla
 
(Stock: scaled 400% for viewing)

Fig. 2 Custom made by Shaun M. D. Morin (GORT)
 
(Higher res texture, but also trying to stay a little truer to the original)

It’s not perfect but as you can see here, most of the shape and lines pretty much match the vanilla texture.  Some HD pack may completely change the texture(s) to something very different.  This may alter or ruin the original artistic intent.

NOTICE:  This FM campaign was constructed and tested on a PC with these specs:

		Windows 10 64-bit
		1 Sapphire Dual-X R9 270X 2GB Radeon Graphic (PCIe)
		AMD FX 8350 8-core Unlocked (Black Edition) 4.00Ghz
		16GB of RAM
		Sound Blaster X-Fi Extreme Music Sound Card (PCI)
		ASUS M5A99FX Pro R2.0 Motherboard

	Have at least above a 2.00 Ghz 2-core Processor in your PC.  Have at least 8GB of DDR3 RAM.  Ideal for 16GB or higher in DDR3 RAM.  Also, a good PCIe video card (at least 2 GB or more).

	The old versions of Darkloader and Garrettloader are NOT supported by this FM campaign.  Use FM Selector, AngelLoader, or NewDarkloader instead.

Commentary Note:
	This 2 missions campaign takes place between the missions Framed and Ambush.
The difficulties are Normal, Daring, and… GORTTUFF.  If you are new to my FMs, you may want to work your way up by starting on Normal.  However, if you know what you’re getting into and want my usual shenanigans (don’t say I didn’t warn you), then go for GORTTUFF if you dare!

WARNING: 
There might be a chance that Thief 2 will have the rope bug in it.  This bug will make the player bounce off the ropes at a great speed and may kill the player by hitting the wall. It’s possible that it might have something to do with how the player is on the terrain.  To avoid this bug, you may want to jump in place before going for the rope.

*Notice*
	
	This FM campaign uses custom scripts needed for various events to function.
