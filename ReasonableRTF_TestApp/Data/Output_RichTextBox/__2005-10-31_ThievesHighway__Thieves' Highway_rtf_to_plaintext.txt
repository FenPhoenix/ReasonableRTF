Release Date:    Oct 30, 2005

This mission is not meant to be complicated. There is no huge mystery to unlock, no major objectives to hurdle. It's a mission meant for people to have fun climbing the 
rooftops of Dayport, snooping everywhere the can find, and stealing loot galore.

A while back you cleaned out the Escarpment Gallery. You assumed that the curator's 
career would be finished, but you were surprised to see his name in the Dayport Society Page. James David Figalily has a new exhibit on the west end at the Fembound Gallery. You just can't resist easy pickings, and plan on hitting his new establishment tonight.

No Briefing

Thanks to beta testers!!!: maloo, Dussander, Dafydd,& Schwaa.
Missions need to be played so they can be tweaked, and beta testers are an invaluable part of the mission building process.
As always, I must give special thanks also to Nightwalker for putting up with constantly being pestered by me during the entire mission process. I must be more annoying to her than a little kid constantly tugging on her pantleg, but she always has comments and suggestions for me.
