*Foreword*

This FM is a full rework of my old FM "Project Hammer" from the year 2009/2010.
This is the first mission of the campaign "Project Hammer".
The following mission will be based on my second released FM "Hand of Glory".

For all those who played the original "Project Hammer" FM and wonder if it's worth it to play the remastered version:
Yes, absolutely. Besides the full overhaul of the original content there is also a lot of new content. (Will you find all 3 SECRET objectives?) 
For more information (spoiler free) please take a look at the topic "Construction" down below.


*Prelude*

Chronologically this FM takes place after the assassination of Ramirez and before the mission for Victoria to steal Constantine's sword.


*Description*

I let some time pass after the assassinations so the City Wardens would not be on the lookout for me any longer.
After I went out to scout around for future lucrative burglary opportunities, I got a new job from an unknown person. I didn't meet my client in 
person, but the payment is overly generous for the little effort this job requires.

It seems my client is at odds with the Hammerites. He wants some information about a project with the code word "Hammer" but they are being 
tight-lipped. His own research led him to a hot clue in the North Quarter. A rich nobleman lives there who evidently has connections to the 
Hammerites and the so called "Project Hammer". The estate is too well guarded for him, so he can't take further action by himself.

That is the point where I get involved. I'll break into the estate and search for all the details I can get about "Project Hammer". Who knows? 
Maybe I'll get the chance to steal some valuables along the way.

For many thieves, Bafford's manor would be a challenge, but a property at the edge of town, far away from any police station, should be an easy job 
for me.

* Construction *

Base 	:	"Project Hammer" from the year 2009/2010
Idea 	:
Because this was my first released FM and a really primitive one, I wanted to remaster it with the new NewDark engine.
Results 	:
		I kept the basic idea for the map layout with the story intact. The visual aspects of the FM have changed/improved a lot.
		Although the game play area didn't expand too much, I've added many details to the overall map.
The estate now has a believable front facade (with roof!), there are many secrets to discover (3 SECRET objectives) and new areas to explore. In addition, the story got a lot more detailed and expanded.

* Installation *

Put the FM in your FM folder as usual. Launch Darkloader, select <FM Name> but don't start it, close Darkloader instead. In your Darkloader 
directory, open Darkloader.ini and search for <FM Name>.
Replace type=2 by type=1 and start Darkloader again. You're set!
