Description	 : 

This summer the old ways are just not the same. I decided to not spend too much on the holiday, but I did. Now, I need some money. A friend told me about a man who lives in a modern house nearby. He is rich and often goes to far countries and small islands with his friends. Rumors say that he and his guards like to study tribes and other civilisations. I could imagine what kind of studying could it be… My friend said, he even stole an idea from a tribe, his guards wear a yellow helmet a few months ago. From one of his recent trips, he brought a nice tribal mask. I wonder if he got it without any violence.. So, this tribal mask is my goal now. Also, If I see some nice vases, or guard-payments around, I won’t hesitate to take them. I jumped in from the roof, because the house has some removeable roof-windows. Since this house is not too far from my place, I mustn’t get noticed while I’m here.

Some advices :

Look around everywhere carefully, some things are well hidden. Use your stleath, this is a true anti-Quake type of level. 

Other:

Note that the ’don’t alert anyone’ objective is checked until you fail it.

Have fun with it, we’re glad to present you this level! J
