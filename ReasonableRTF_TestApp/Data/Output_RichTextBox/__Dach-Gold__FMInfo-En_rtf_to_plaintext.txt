Story:

A successful night is drawing to an end, again Garrett hustled some money from a rich merchant.
Time to have a drink, isn't it?
Seems the beer was too strong - when Garrett wakes up again, there is no trace nor of his loot nor
of his equipment. Stolen? From the Master Thief himself?
Having a look around he sees the same faces, all those people who were in the bar before. But
what about those voices?
Garrett leaves the bar, something draws him to the Hammerite church. What does he find? A scroll!
He doesn't know what's going on here, but he has a bad feeling about it ...
