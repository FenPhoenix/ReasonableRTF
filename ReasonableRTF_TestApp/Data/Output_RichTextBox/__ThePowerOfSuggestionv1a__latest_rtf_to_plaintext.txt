The last thing you remember, you were on your way home from the Crippled Burrick after enjoying a bowl of stew. Two men approached you, one from the left, one directly in front of you. They thought you wouldn't notice the third man in the shadows to the right, but they were wrong. Or were they? These men were prepared for your level of skill, and just slightly too late, you heard the fourth man approach from behind. Now you've awoken in cramped quarters without your blackjack or any other equipment. It's time to get out of here and find out what's going on.....

Note Well

-Listen to conversations carefully for instructions on story and how to proceed. Some will be helpful. This mission is less than linear, so don't expect all clues to be timed just when you need them, etc.     
-A word on the trees: They are climbable to help you get into a couple of places, but are just as pesky as timing a jump forward from a ladder. They are not like rope arrows. They will take a little practice. When you get to your first tree, do a save just before then, and start practicing. You'll get the hang of it.
-If you are having difficulties mantling onto an object or ledge, remember to walk up to it until touching it, then back up one half step before jumping. That often helps.
