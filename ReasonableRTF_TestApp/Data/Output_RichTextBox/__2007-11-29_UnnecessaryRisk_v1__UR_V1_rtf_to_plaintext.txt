Description: A Thief 2 Fan Mission  
                       This is the sequel to "A Friend In Need."
                       It's not necessary to play AFIN first but it is recommended.


Briefing:  You've broken into the law offices of Dewey, Cheatem & Howe in order
                  to discover the location of Lord Bafford's new summer residence.  Now that
                  you have it, it's time to pay the place a visit.  It's really an unnecessary risk
                  as you don't need the money...but hey...it's another chance to piss off
                  Lord Bafford!

                  No sense in waiting...It's time to begin. 


Note From SlyFoxx:  If you cause a lot of commotion in certain locations and/or knock out 
                                      certain AI, you'll be missing out on key bits of information.  So if you 
                                      plan to run around like this is Unreal Tournament don't be surprised if 
                                      you get surprised or can't find most of the loot!  That said, there are things
                                      in this mission that you can only experience if you are a bloodthirsty taffer
                                      who likes to slice people up! 

                                     If you get up in the guard towers and look back towards the main house
                                     you'll be getting a view that will test the limits of the game engine.  I have
                                     experienced no crashes but do suggest a quick save before doing so.

                                     There are some AI conversations in this mission.  They are triggered by
                                     something called a Bounds Trigger.  The trigger is destroyed almost 
                                     immediatly after it does its thing so the conversation only plays once.
                                     What that means to you is that if you keep moving while inside the
                                     trigger area before it gets destroyed the conversation will keep starting
                                     over.  So if you just hold still for a few seconds everything will be good.

                                     As is often the case the pick pocket stats at the end of the mission are
                                     incorrect.  The correct total is 9.

                                    This mission is not very difficult.  It's not supposed to be.  It almost didn't
                                    get finished but I had promised a sequel to "A Friend In Need" and I do
                                    my best to keep my promises.  It also served as a learning experience as to
                                    how to implement more "fancy DromEd stuff."  So though the game-play
                                    is on the easy side this is by far the most complex and challenging mission
                                    I have ever released from a design standpoint.
