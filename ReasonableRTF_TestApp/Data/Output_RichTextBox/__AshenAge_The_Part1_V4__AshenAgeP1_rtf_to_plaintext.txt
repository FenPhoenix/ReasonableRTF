Title	:	The Ashen Age Part 1

Description	:	Thief 2 Fan Mission

Story	:  A rash of disappearances plague the city.  Rich and poor alike are vanishing without a trace while the City Watch stands idle, powerless to stop the menace.  Garrett is contacted by the Keeper Order who claim that 4 of their own have gone missing.  It is no co-incidence that these 4 have been taken.  Each of these Keepers shared in the burden of protecting the "Book of Ash", a book capable of unleashing hell on earth.  There isn't time to wait till nightfall this time. . .

Known bugs 	:  Some difficulty levels may (or may not!) have a zombie that just won't stay put!
Briefing(s)	:	No
