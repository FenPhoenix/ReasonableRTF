Dear Diary,
Boy, I am in a pickle for sure!  I was caught red handed as the thief who nabbed the king's loot.  Personally, I think my wife ratted me out!  But rather than toss me in the dungeon where I belong, the King has asked me to return everything I've stolen.  He thinks I know where it all is, but I have a nasty secret... I don't have a clue!  But if I can track it all down and return it to the castle, I'll get a full pardon.  Well I stole it all once, I can do it again.  Time to get to work!

Special thanks to:

ImmortalThief for additional character skins

Ireth Kalt for the animal puzzle and menu artwork

Zappen for the German translation. Zappen translated well over 300 files!

Nameless Voice for his help in solving a very annoying-crash-to-desktop style bug, and for the NVRelayTrap without which none of this would have been possible.

Telliamed for his help in solving another very annoying bug, and for tnhscript which this mission relies on so heavily.

Yandros for the use of his site to host the testing

Many many thanks to: Antimatter_16, Haplo, Malau, nightchild, R_G, Saggital and SeventyFour for their support and feedback @TTLG.  With their help I managed to sort out a number of random bugs in the first release.  My admiration and gratitude for the people of the Thief community grows more and more by the day!
