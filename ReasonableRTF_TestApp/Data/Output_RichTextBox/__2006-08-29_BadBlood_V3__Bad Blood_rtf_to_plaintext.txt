Bad Blood, v3.0

This version includes numerous fixes, mostly dealing with texture and room brushing issues.
I also added more loot to make the loot objective a bit easier.

Bad Blood: You have business in the sleepy town of Airsdale. Unfortunately, a serial rapist and 
murderer has been on the loose, and the town folk are demanding the perp be found. The local 
boys lay the blame on you. Thrown in jail and facing execution, you escape with only the clothes
on your back. Alone, penniless, and hunted, you have 3 priorities: get your equipment back, steal
the town blind, and find and kill the real perp.
