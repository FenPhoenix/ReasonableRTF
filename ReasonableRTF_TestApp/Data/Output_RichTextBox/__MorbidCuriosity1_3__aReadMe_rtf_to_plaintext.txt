Morbid Curiosity
NewDark 1.24  
Author:	 PukeyBrunster
Release date:	October 2016
Version:   1.3 – Included loot list (by Jiasonz) in zip file, and included new text file Secrets-Equipment in case anyone needs help finding these.

Important Note: 
You may need to run the game on Newdark 1.24 for it to work properly, as well as disabling mods.  Some players have had inexplicable crashes, which I am hoping either of the above can fix.

Some players may experience long loading times.

STORY:

The Hammers are after an item called The Builder’s Rattle.  It’s an ancient icon that was stolen by one of their own priests. 
 
Thieving from a thief is always irresistible.  No doubt this priest is on the run, and I’ve learned that the item is on its way to Bledwater.  It’s a town about two days from here, where my contact Peyton has been fencing some of my more high profile items over the years.  
  
I’ll need Peyton to stash some equipment for me, as I’ll be swimming in under Southgate.  On my last visit, I spent most of the time in a prison cell, and I’d rather not announce my arrival this time just in case they remember me.

This part of town is known for its tourists, and with any luck I can blend in with the rogues and merchants who flock here.  After I finish the job, maybe I’ll take in some sights, sample the wines, or visit the shops like the rest of them.  At any rate, I’m looking forward to a change of scenery.

This priest won’t even know what hit him by the time I’ve sold his hammer to the highest bidder, and taken my leave.

 

DIFFICULTY: 
Normal: Fewer AI, easier/optional objectives
Hard: Some fewer AI, somewhat easier/optional objectives
Expert: Challenging, with additional optional objective not available in other levels

KNOWN ISSUES: 
Save one of each arrow (water, earth, fire, gas) to complete a certain objective later on.  Near the certain area these arrows can be found – you just have to look around for them, and don’t use them all up from there.

There are some readables that are triggers to complete objectives, or set off a sequence of events.  Although you don’t have to read them, you will need to frob some of them, and it is suggested you should try to read them to make completing the mission easier.  Most contain clues or information relative to the mission, and I aimed for brevity where possible so as to avoid long readables.

Beta Testers did not run into this, but on occasional playthroughs, the player’s arm has disappeared on me.  Weapons work fine, but the visible arm of Garrett can't be seen.  This seems to happen when too many AI are alerted at one time, but so far I am the only person who has experienced this.  In case this happens to you, I have been able to remedy by starting the mission over.

Some players have had trouble with sound.  I downgraded certain sound files to 16 bit (thank you Fen) which I am told works with Hardware Acceleration and EAX turned on.  Otherwise, the only fix has been to disable HA and EAX.
