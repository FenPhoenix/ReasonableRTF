Version	:	2.0 (May 06, 2021)
Description	:	I heard a rumor at the bar in a town I visited last night about a castle nearby. The
		thieves I heard talking about it said that it is abandoned and that it had been for
		many years. I really have to check it out. It's empty, but not empty of loot
		apparently. It's a sunny day, why not take a walk up to the castle and clean it up
		a bit.
