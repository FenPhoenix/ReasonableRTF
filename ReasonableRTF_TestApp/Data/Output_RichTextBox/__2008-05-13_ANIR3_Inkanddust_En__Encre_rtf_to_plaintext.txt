* Description *      

The third mission of my six-mission campaign. This is a keeper-like mission

This mission is the sequel to « Discovery ».

=====================================================

* Briefing *

You'd better watch the video...  ;)

To be brief, It happens just after the two previous missions. Garrett is in the sewers. He’s trying to escape from the city of Rocksbourg according to Keeper Artemus’ advices, but he is in the dark and hasn’t much equipement left. He hears sounds everywhere, from the ventilation shafts and the pipes, the place is invaded by zombies.

He finds an old lantern on the ground, and decides to take it in order to have light. Unfortunately, what he feared happens, he is discovered by the undead. He runs for his life through the underground tunnels of the city, but ends up in a dead end.

Suddenly, a portal opens, and a voice can be heard : «If your survival is important to you, come with me, right now ». As the undead are approaching him, he doesn’t wait long and jump into the portal. The mission begins.

* BUGS BUGS BUGS *

Some AI might act oddly or have a strange behavior, due to the complexity of the mission.

The portable lantern might stop working at moments. The mission is so complex sometimes the light gets stuck in a wall, but only in complex zones, like a rotated brush or an architectural detail. This is a bug from the engine, nothing can be done for it, I pushed dromed too far. Still, you simply need to walk into the light and it gets back to Garrett. Hopefully, the mission can be finished without the lantern, it is just a bonus to help the players.

DO NOT interrupt the conversations, and don’t forget to act (following an AI who’s speaking to you, like if you were having a conversation while having a walk).

In large views, as there would be too many things in sight the game might slow down or lag, some objects might also disappear from the screen.

=====================================================

* Recommendations *

Minimum System Requirements are higher than for T2, you'd better have an updated system if you want to play my fm. You should play the mission after a fresh boot.

ATTENTION : you must have an original and clean installation of the game. Uninstall graphic packs, especially the Thief enhancement pack, before playing this mission. If you don’t want to uninstall the Thief enchancement pack, well expect major bugs...

Listen to entire conversations. Some give you clues, others give new objectives. 

You must create keys in the mission : only the keys to the Light Zone and the Dark Zone are necessary, the other keys are optionnals. You don’t need to visit everything in the mission to complete it.

You don’t need to read everything in the mission. The important readables, the ones related to your objectives, end up in your inventory. You can skip the others, but you can also miss a few hints and secrets...

Also, you should play with fog for best atmosphere.
