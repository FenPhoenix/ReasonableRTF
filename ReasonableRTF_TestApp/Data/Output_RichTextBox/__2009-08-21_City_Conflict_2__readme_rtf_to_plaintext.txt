         City Conflict (part2)

 
The hammers offered me another job. This time, I have to sneak into the other part of town. The town is seperated by a long, metal wall, which is strong and ,at the entry points, well protected. From my previous 'visit' at the local embassy, I know that there excists a hole in one of the buildings, which are connected with the wall.
 
Once I'm at the other part of town, I'll have to search for the abandoned church, which was bought by the mechanists some weeks ago.
Rumours say that they also have stored some information about their spies and sabouteurs deep in the cellars of the church.
 
I'll have to be quick and find those infos before the mechanists put them somewhere else...
