Version	:	1.2
Description	:	I left the City because the cops were getting too close to me.
		I've been in this city, Lonmore, for a month now.
	I have a nice apartment, rather expensive, so my savings are getting thin.
	I love this city. Lots of rich people with fat purses.
	But I need something bigger. Something that brings me a lot of loot.
	I guess I could visit some other houses tonight, while I'm out. Time to begin.
