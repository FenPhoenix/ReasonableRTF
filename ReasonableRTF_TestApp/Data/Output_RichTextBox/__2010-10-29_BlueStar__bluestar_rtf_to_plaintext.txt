A few days ago I was approached by a hooded man. It turned out that he was one of those mages in town and he offered me a job. They want me to steal an artifact for them, "The Blue Star", that is currently shown at the Shalebridge Museum. It is said that this gemstone is cursed, but that it also has hidden magical powers. I suppose the mages needs it for their own dark rituals. Normally I wouldn´t want to get involved in their business, but this time I will make an exception. I´ve had my eye on this museum for quite some time now, but I´ve been too busy running nightly "errands" for shady collectors in town to plan something serious. This will be a good opportunity to get to know the insides of that place. Maybe I can get something for myself as well..

I will find my way inside using the abandoned sewers that run beneath the museum. The entrance happens to be at the backyard of one of my favourite inns, The Golden Pig. 

I guess it pays off being out drinking once in a while..
