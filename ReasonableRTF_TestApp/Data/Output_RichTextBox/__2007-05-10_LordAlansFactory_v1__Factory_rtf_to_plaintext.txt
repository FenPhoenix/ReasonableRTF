§ Forward §

Greetings, SlyFoxx here.

I've just returned from a long night's work and I've got to say my feet are sore.
I've stolen from gods, nobles, vagabonds and thieves.  
I've travelled time, reversed the order, solved mysteries, fought the dead,
explored forbidden places, uncovered prophecy, loved and lost.
But I must say, none of that quite prepared me for what I experienced in Lord Alan's Factory.
Amidst the whirring machinery and the perilous heights of narrow catwalks,
I uncovered a story of one man's avarice and another's tragedy...
all set upon one of the grandest stages ever constructed for your amusement.  

I'll go no further into the nature of the evening's events here. 
I have had my time and now you will have your’s.  
So dim the lights and lock your doors.  

It's time to begin...

§ Story §

“Basso delivered to me a letter hiring me for a new job.
 An unknown person has asked me to sneak into ROENT,
 best known as Lord Alan's Factory, and find a way to use a series of codes. 
Apparently, it's industrial espionage.
 It is strange that the message does not mention a reward.
 I don't see the reason why I should sneak into that noisy factory for nothing.
 Perhaps I'll wait to find the connection between these codes and Lord Alan's business,
 then I will set my price.”
