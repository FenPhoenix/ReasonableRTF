Title			: The Way of The Sword

Description		: Thief 2 Fan Mission

Story			: A fence came to me with a request.  A collector is looking for an ancient artifact, The Talisman of Death.  Trouble is that its being kept by a local Hammerite monastery.  Seems the Hammerites fear the talisman and keep it under pretty close guard.  The last couple of thieves to go after this one were never heard from again.

It’s a tough job, but nothing is impossible for the greatest thief in the world.  While I’m there I should look for a few other artifacts.  The Sword of the Builder should bring a good price, magical swords always do.  These Hammerites are also known to have a secret fighting technique.  If I could find a copy of their fighting manual it could be valuable.
