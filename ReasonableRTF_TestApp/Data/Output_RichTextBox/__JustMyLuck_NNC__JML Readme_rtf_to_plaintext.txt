Briefing
"I shares with them my fortunes and my wealths,
Yet they not bes satisfied; they bes wanting it all.
And now my pride and joys bes is stoled away.
Their headsies be is poisoned with greed.
So now bes it up to me to cure and heals them
By stealing away their precious lifesies."
- last page of a journal found in a desolate Pagan village

	Cobbleton Square has become a popular topic of conversation over the past few weeks. It's a place in the heart of Stonemarket where lower-class folks would come by to purchase some market goods, check out the local oddities, and enjoy a book in the public library. But one night, around the beginning of the month, a ghost was spotted walking around in the square. Initially, no one thought much of it, assuming it to be the ghost of a man who once lived in Cobbleton Square until he was ambushed and murdered by a thief in his home. However, more and more ghosts started to appear, attacking any passerby they laid their eyes on. People quickly took the hint, and now the square is completely deserted; even the locals who lived there and ran the shops are nowhere to be found.
	It's only logical to assume, then, that the residents might have forgotten some of their belongings in their rush to leave the specters behind. So tonight, you've decided to visit Cobbleton Square and see what you can scrounge up. Who knows? Maybe if you're lucky, you'll come away with a big score...

Author's Notes
-   Higher difficulty settings mean less health, less equipment, a higher loot requirement, and altered AI patrols.
-   I recommend that you crouch before trying to mantle through the windows. You'll be more likely to succeed.
