Plot:

She appeared again overnight. The proud ship of the Mechanists called M.S. Gold. For several years she was believed to be lost without a trace and now lies again in the waters of our town. This is the biggest talking point and they say that the ship's name has not been chosen without a reason. It would be helpful to grab some precious items from the vessel in order to get by for the next few weeks.
[…]
Maybe it was a mistake to enter the ship during this damnable weather. I've lost all of my equipment. Well, I'll look  around a little bit - although I've got the feeling that I should hurry …
