Version: 1.0

This mission was begun for the Thief Anniversary Contest, but I missed the deadline.  It still adheres to the space restriction of the contest.

Story
You recently met with an informant, who was told by a guard that works in the City Hall Annex that there is a case file on you being kept there.  Sounds like a little trip to the Annex is in order, to make sure that your case file gets 'lost'... that way if you're ever unlucky enough to get caught by the bulldogs, none of your past sins can be held against you.  You pry open a window in the basement and slip inside...
