Mission Briefing :

First mission of the campaign.

Bookshop owner Kielnia hired you to learn the source of where the valuable items come from. These items sell on the market and the person who offers them is Marucha. Undoubtfully Kielnia wishes to get ahold of these items. But your task is to make profit on this ordeal, as well as to learn who stands behind Marucha. A simple peasant as himself wouldn't be able to arrange selling of the antiques. Additionally, it's worth knowing who you steal from, it might save your life or be of other use. After all, information is the best deposit you can make, as well as life insurance. Let's move on! You hope to leave this forgotten forest by dawn. Forgotten by humans and gods....
