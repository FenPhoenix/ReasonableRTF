Castle Michele
A Thief 2 FM by Ricebug & Xorak
Uses Dark Engine V1.22
 

TURN ON WEATHER AND FOG TO PLAY THIS MISSION.

Rather thin plot line:

Garrett is approaching his retirement years. The last thing he needs is to take on another difficult challenge.
Unfortunately, an unexpected letter from Basso drops like a flash bomb from his front door mail slot. It seems that
some shady business may be behind a woman’s demise, a lady he vaguely remembers as ‘Michele.’ She got him
out of a jam in Murkbell. What goes around comes around. He decides to take the long trip into the country to 
unravel this mystery.
