Technical Info

Warnings
 
All "improvements"(models, textures, and others) can cause various inconsistencies in the game. Changing water textures causes the most critical changes. Campaign was tested on the original version only.
Before starting, be sure to check if you can see original video files in the game. If not, videos will not work in the campaign, and you will miss a lot of important things.
"Prologue" from the start menu should be seen before the game starts, "Authors" from the same place - only after the completion of the entire campaign. These videos do not start automatically at the right time.
In Mission 1, it is almost impossible to collect all the pickpockets. Some of them become available only after inconceivable tricks. However, those that are absolutely out of touch are not included in the statistics.
In Mission 4, use the signal device, only being in complete safety, otherwise you can be detected, and the mission is failed. It is not recommended to use the signal device while the elevator is moving and when you are on the ladder.
In Mission 8, not all guards are hostile. You can try to talk with some of them. Confrontation with them can lead to the inability to complete the investigation.
In mission 9, the activator code is randomly assigned. Do not try to use the codes prompted by other players.
Never save a game during conversations! Be patient, listen to the end and save later.
