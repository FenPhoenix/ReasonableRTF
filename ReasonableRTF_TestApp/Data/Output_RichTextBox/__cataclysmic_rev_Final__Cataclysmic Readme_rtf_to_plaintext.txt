STORY: The World has changed.  The Earth and it's People are Crying out for answers.  The Keepers usually unseen unless they choose to be seen have placed glyphs throughout
the lands.  The Glyphs not unseen by Garrett, steal his curiosity.  The Hammerites have increased their activities, and for some unknown reasons have established themselves once
again, in the "The Haunted Cathedral"   Now Excorcised, the Hammers have gathered to do "Thy Builders Work"  The Cathedral and it's Shrines, hold memory of Saint Yora, Saint Jenel,
Saint Tennor, and Saint Vale.   The Victorious Saints who continually fight the evil in the World.                     
 
Meteor's and Comet's are frequenting the night skies.  The Moon has turned red ,and rumbles of earthquakes stir great fear into the hearts of men.   Last night at the 
Taffer's Tavern, Fingers the Fingerman spoke a little too loudly, mentioning something about something "suspicious" at the old institution.  Garrett's keen sense drives him further,
as he remembered the nightmare that once existed inside those walls. " Hammers moving back into that place?"  Garrett sets out to find out why the Hammer's have moved back in,
and intends to discover also what the Keepers are doing, and possibly learn what they know.  No time like the present, because there may not be much time left !   And, like always, the
rent must be paid.

Technical Information: Script used: NvScript.osm  First version has 3 custom made videos: Introduction, Success, and Death.  All .avi movies made with Indeo codec: IV50
Known Issues: Framerate may be low in some areas, but a modern machine should handle it with no problems.  Has not been tested on Windows98, or Windows2000.
In part of the second half of the mission the player will have to cycle through the weapons, as some of them cannot be assigned keys or numbers.
This mission is at it's limits, but the pal count is only 151.  It is equivalent to 2 Original Missions placed in 1 mission file.  It is huge !  Have fun, as it was made for fun only !
