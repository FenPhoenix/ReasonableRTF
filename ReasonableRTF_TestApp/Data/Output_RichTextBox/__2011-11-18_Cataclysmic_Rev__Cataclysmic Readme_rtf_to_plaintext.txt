Revision May 21st 2013: Version 1.18 T2, limited this mission for object id's, so New Dark enabled a hefty revision. Prior to the revision, object id space was used to the maximmum in V.1.18  Included in this revision is Well over 1000 objects added including more Ai, some secrets,and a new starting area. Final Revision Difficulty Adjustment. May 28th,2012 Rev1.3  Added some powerups in the other world. Lowered hitpoints on some ai, and added more secrets, and one more area for player.  Made playing less tedious on Hard and Expert Levels.




===================================================================================
STORY: The World has changed.  The Earth and it's People are Crying out for answers.  The Keepers usually unseen unless they choose to be seen have placed glyphs throughout
the lands.  The Glyphs not unseen by Garrett, steal his curiosity.  The Hammerites have increased their activities, and for some unknown reasons have established themselves once
again, in the "The Haunted Cathedral"   Now Excorcised, the Hammers have gathered to do "Thy Builders Work"  The Cathedral and it's Shrines, hold memory of Saint Yora, Saint Jenel,
Saint Tennor, and Saint Vale.   The Victorious Saints who continually fight the evil in the World.                     
 
Meteor's and Comet's are frequenting the night skies.  The Moon has turned red ,and rumbles of earthquakes stir great fear into the hearts of men.   Last night at the 
Taffer's Tavern, Fingers the Fingerman spoke a little too loudly, mentioning something about something "suspicious" at the old institution.  Garrett's keen sense drives him further,
as he remembered the nightmare that once existed inside those walls. " Hammers moving back into that place?"  Garrett sets out to find out why the Hammer's have moved back in,
and intends to discover also what the Keepers are doing, and possibly learn what they know.  No time like the present, because there may not be much time left !   And, like always, the
rent must be paid.

Playing Info:Some objectives are optional, as the mission is split into 2 separate worlds.  Instead of having to give up because of incomplete objectives, because of it's enormous size, I thought 
it best this way.  The feeling of lonliness is intentional,without alot of material comfort in Version 1.18, but due to some reports, some players thought it wasn't full enough for exploration. So, with about 100 hours of rework, I believe it is improved for experience and game play.

Known Issues: Framerate may be low in some areas, but a modern machine should handle it with no problems.  Has not been tested on Windows98, or Windows2000.
In part of the second half of the mission the player will have to cycle through the weapons, as some of them cannot be assigned keys or numbers.
This mission is at it's limits, but the pal count is only 151.(Old 1.18)  It is equivalent to 2 Original Missions placed in 1 mission file.  It is huge !  Have fun, as it was made for fun only !
