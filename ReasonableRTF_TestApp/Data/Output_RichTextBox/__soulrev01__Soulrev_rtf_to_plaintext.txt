        SOULFORGE REVISITED


Sheriff Mosely contacted you the other day about a situation that
has developed at Soulforge. Shortly after Karras legions abandoned
the cathedral they were replaced by hostile forces and consequently
nobody has been able to penetrate very far into the complex. 
Mosely does not know who or what these forces are but she suspects 
that their activities are illegal or subversive. She sent in a 
secret agent to investigate but he has not returned and nothing has 
been heard of him.

Mosely asked you to go in there, find out what is going on and tell
her when it is safe to mount a raid.  As a reward she will turn a 
blind eye if you choose to pocket any loot items you may find.
That's not much inducement to undertake such a dangerous task,
but you've heard rumours in town that there may be some priceless
ancient artefacts hidden inside Soulforge.  Finding those would 
justify the risk.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Note: At some stage you may have to disable a combat bot. Mines, 
2 fire arrows, 2 frogbeasts, or 2 water arrows(into the firebox)
will disable bots at long range.  If you have to get up close,
sword and blackjack will eventually prevail.
