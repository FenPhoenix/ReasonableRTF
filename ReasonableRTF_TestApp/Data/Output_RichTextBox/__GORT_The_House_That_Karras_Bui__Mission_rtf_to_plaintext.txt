*Things you need to know*

This is my first FM!
The mission in this FM is not made very good.  All and all, this mission should be playable.  It just sucks soooooooooooooo bad that I’m ashamed to bring this out.
However, I did get some good ideas from it.  Anyway, the objectives are weird; there are a few gotcha traps, and a few plain mazes.  If you need help in this FM, you’ll know where to find me.

Distribution of these levels are allowed in any way, shape, or manner you wish (don't forget the credit...).  However, you must leave the mission intact and give me credit for it.  The custom pictures and sounds effects that are in this mission should not be taken because I made them!
(If you want them SO badly, just ask me what you want and maybe I'll allow it.)

Have fun! :-)

These levels were not made and are not supported by Looking Glass Studios or Eidos Interactive (as if you didn't know already).  Although they work fine for me, it may not work for others.
I'm pretty sure there's nothing wrong, but you'll never know.  Sometimes, computers have their hissy fit about something.  Anyway, it's up to you.  Play this mission set at thy own risk.  MUAH HA HA!!! >D
