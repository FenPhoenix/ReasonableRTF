                This is my first mission. Actually, this is the first part of story Snobs.

Description:                “I became rich and famous, almost a legend, in this beautiful town named Richpoor. For the first time in my life I have a chance to live well,because I bought a nice house here and I have some good friends, too. They are very poor but honest.  Richpoor has perfect local  food and drinks...hmmm, I would like to stay here for a long time. Besides,something new has happened to me - love.Yes, I have a fiancee here in Richpoor named Lora. She is beautiful, and endlessly in love with me. Maybe I'll finally have a chance to live a  more dignified life? Maybe?"
 IMPORTANT: Read scrolls and listen conversations (it’s not long and boring). The story “Snobs” does not follow original story line of “Thief”. Aim is only one - have a fun!
