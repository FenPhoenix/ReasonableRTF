About this mission

This is more of a demo, really… I will likely never finish my mission Spoof: The Daft Project,
which was to spoof well-known movies and TV shows.  So I’m releasing the only part of it
which I’ve completed – a farce in the style of the old Benny Hill skits where everyone ran around
at high speed to the strains of “Yakety Sax”.  The Trickster himself will run around and be silly
along with plenty of your other Thief favorites.  Once it’s done, all the participants will fall down
dead, and you can then go explore.  When you’re done, press the large button at the end of the
hall.  There’s really nothing to this mission except a good laugh.


Known Issues

1. Don’t frob the victrola more than once.  It will very quickly become unfrobbable, but if you’re
clicking like mad and manage to click it twice, you’ll break it so the AI’s don’t begin moving
and will have to restart (not that that’s a big deal in a mission like this, but just so you know…)

2. Once during testing, the game crashed to desktop just as the music ended and the AI’s were
all supposed to die.  I have no idea why and can’t reproduce this, so if it happens, try replaying
(if you’re masochistic enough to sit through it again).
