\par than one player felt that accessing the cathedral was part of this mission and that somehow this extremely 
\par odd method for reaching the cathedral area was just a pleasant shortcut \endash  rather than what it was: a back-
\par stage look at things to come.
\par 
\par Except by unplanned and extreme methods, the cathedral area in Hallucinations can no longer be reached.

\par }{\fs20\ul Ways to Crash the Mission (as in crashing the game or your computer)
\par }{\fs20 
\par }\pard \ql \li450\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin450\itap0 {\fs20 So far, I know of only a few areas that might cause a game crash:
\par 
\par 1. The upper (green portion) roof of the cathedral near the gable ends. 
\par Without a speed potion (or some fancy trick) you can't get up there anyhow, 
\par but somebody is bound to try.
\par 
\par 2. Jumping through the ice and looking back up at the cathedral. This is probably 
\par okay -- but in theory it might be a problem. At any rate, if you jump through 
\par the ice, Garrett will die anyway due to the current which sweeps him away and the 
\par freezing water.
\par 
\par 3. Scouting orbs have a wider field of view than the normal screen, and in some
\par places this was causing screen complexity crashes -- so they have been removed.
\par Speed potions were removed because this would allow access to all sorts of
\par evil locations (with respect to screen complexity).
\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20 
\par }{\fs20\ul A way for Garrett to die (unplanned or expected)
\par }{\fs20 
\par Seems Mr. SlyFoxx (and I) have gotten into the habit of dumping knocked-out Mechanists through the 
\par balcony openings onto the main floor below. But wouldn't you know that leaning out through such a 
\par narrow space while holding a body will confuse the dickens out the Dark Engine. Most likely (if anything 
\par happens), Garrett will get launched out into the space above the main sanctuary, which is not healthy at all!
\par 
\par No way to fix this other than putting a warning here.

\par Do not save and reload when Garrett is attached to a CamVator. There are two CamVators in this mission 
\par and in both cases he will stop at the end and stay attached for a while. If you save and reload, at best, things 
\par may seem screwy; and at worst, you may break the mission so it can not be won. (For those not sure 
\par of what I mean \endash  \'93CamVator\'94 is short for }{\i\fs20 camera elevator}{\fs20 , where Garrett is attached to an invisible moving 
\par platform so the player\rquote s viewpoint can be transported as though watching a movie).
\par 
\par Gravity is that of another world \endash  about the same as Mars. It is part of the design to assume that Garrett can 
\par therefore climb on very steep angles and jump down from very high places which normally would be out of 
\par the question. Just because something looks nearly impossible, it may not be \endash  and may, in fact, be required.
\par 
\par Some odd fogging effects are implemented using a custom technique, so it does not matter if you have
\par these settings on or off in the Thief 2 configuration screen. It will work either way.
\par 
\par The lighting may seem a tad bright. This is done for those machines which display the game too darkly. 
\par If you usually run at maximum brightness, your game may not appear as realistic as I have planned. Use the 
\par minus (-) and plus (+) keys to adjust your screen for a proper on-screen feeling.
\par 
\par Because of the complexity of the terrain, EAX ambient sound is highly recommended. Typical 2-speaker 
\par or headphone use simply may not tell you enough about your threat situation, and you will be at a decided 
\par disadvantage. Having said this, I have most definitely tweaked audio for 2-speaker and headphone use \endash  it 
\par just isn\rquote t as useful as EAX 4-speaker sound.
\par 
\par In four cases, the player must touch (frob) an object from the inside. This may be mentioned in a mission
\par journal, but not always \endash  so I also mention it here to limit confusion.
\par 
\par As with all of my missions, except for the level of annoyance, there is no real difference between Normal, 
\par Hard, and Expert. So it\rquote s really a matter of how long you want to play, and how annoyed you are willing 
\par to become.
\par 
\par There is still more to come\'85 If you win this mission, there will be a "to be continued" screen at the end.

\par }{\fs20 
\par GeForce 2 graphics cards may cause the sky effect to flash with an occasional dark triangle. This is a
\par graphics  board issue, and I have not seen it on other machines. It only happens rarely, and since I have 
\par limited the CPU needed to run the sky effect as much as I can bare, this will remain as it is.
\par 
\par The sky sometimes changes brightness abruptly. At first I tried to fix this, but have decided that it merely 
\par adds to the odd feeling of the place \endash  and since I can\rquote t fix this, I declare it a \'93feature\'94 rather than a bug.

\par Garrett also may be overhearing conversations. If you save and reload during these they may not restart and

\par 
\par In some missions all water may vanish due to overloading the game engine. The water is still there for
