I was minding my own business in the local alehouse when three seedy-looking fellows hidden in the dark caught my attention. I crept on them during their conversation and, by carefully listening to them, I was able to piece together what might be a lucrative haul. 

The cellar of the old Vane manor, located on the western edge of the Red Quarter is, according to them, filled with all kinds of shiny trinkets and baubles ripe for the picking, including the decrepit Lady Vane's family treasure. They were planning a raid there in the following days, but I decided to try and lay my greedy paws on that treasure before them.

I couldn't shake this ghastly feeling off, though, that I somehow knew these three men.

ATTENTION : This mission had no proper betatesting session, it got released as it is. I just hope everything runs fine, and if it doesnâ€™t, sorry for the inconvenience.
