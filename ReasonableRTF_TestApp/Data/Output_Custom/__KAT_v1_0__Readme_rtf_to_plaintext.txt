King Abedzen's Tomb
a very small Thief 2 fan mission by Yandros

Version 1.0 - 10/30/2015


Story:

A hundred miles east of The City, on the coast atop high cliffs, lies an ancient tomb which is one of the last remaining vestiges of the Ruthymian culture which occupied these lands centuries ago.  You have long considered going there to plunder its wealth, but due to its age, have generally assumed that any treasure was likely scavenged ages ago.

Then recently, you came across the writings of a Professor Albrecht Hinatharxus, who died nearly 20 years ago and was The City's most respected expert on the Ruthymians.  This passage in the article caught your eye:

It appears to have been the custom to build a second, well-hidden treasure chamber in most tombs used for royalty, and King Abedzen should have been no exception.  The chamber entrance was typically opened via a clever mechanism disguised with a puzzle.  Upon exploring the tomb some 7 years past, however, I could find no trace of it, although I know it was there, probably still full of Ruthymian artifacts.

Even more curious, upon instructions in his last testament, Hinatharxus himself was buried in the graveyard outside of Abedzen's tomb.  Perhaps it's time to pay a visit to the good professor, and the old king...


Notes:
•	This mission requires a lot of interaction between objects in your inventory and objects in the world.  If an object moves out in front of you when you frob it from inventory, it probably has such a use, and typically will be used on an object in the world which highlights but appears to do nothing when you frob it.
•	Take clues seriously, whether spoken by Garrett or in the form of new objectives.  It is possible to get into a situation where the mission can't be completed and requires a restart if you're not careful. Given the tiny size of the mission, this doesn't represent a significant time investment, but you should still take care and put thought into your actions.
•	You have a new light tool in this mission, a small number of glowstones.  They work very similarly to flares: frob in inventory and it becomes a lit object you can drop or throw, except it stays lit forever.  You can pick them back up, but cannot douse them once lit and cannot return them to inventory, so pick a lit one up only to move it.  Of course you are fully lit and exposed when holding one, and they make noise when dropped or thrown, so use with caution, but this mission is quite dark so you may find them useful.  Note: They will also highlight things in the mission which may spoil future events, such as making traps and secret doors noticeable, so if you prefer to be surprised, you may want to avoid using them. Just a fair warning.
