====================================================
Made from scratch using NewDark V.1.2.1  Technical issues in sound propagation
may occur since construction of the world was made with up to 26 sided cylinders. Also,
low framerate may occur in some areas. Some of the framerate has been reduced in Revised Edition.
If you do not have NvScipt.osm V.1.2.4 you may extract the version in the zip to your T2 directory.
Hammered.osm must be in the zip to function properly.
This was built uing an old 2004 xp machine-1gig ram,256mb nvidial video card, and 2 ghz processor.
Disable ep.crf or any program used to enhance texture and object textures by renaming ep.crf to
ep.crf_null.  You can remove the extention to resume your normal ep.crf function after playing this fm.
No ep is required, as this fm is made with almost 100 percent custom content.

Story
The age of earthquakes,famine,and war has come!
Times are rough, as Toxic rock is spewing from the earth.  Volcanoes are active, and water and land creatures are dying of Toxic poisoning.  Food and water are scarce.  The cities are suffering from being heavily reliant on mountain water run off.  People are moving about the globe, attempting to find safety and clean food to eat. 

I overheard a couple of thugs speak of a Hammerite fortress located in the Mountains. They spoke of a Hammerite shipment of steel and rivets, and a precious war hammer known as the "BloodStone Hammer".  Supposedly, the Hammer was used in a great war, and was so named because of all the blood it spilled.  It is said to be spotted with rubies and gems, and inlaid with solid silver and gold.  I bought the thugs more mugs of ale and assessed the job as a good bet for shaking up some loot I need for catching up on my rent.  Food is worth almost as much as gold, and water is even more precious now.

I will get to it, as there is no time to waste!
