INTRODUCTION :

Note: This mission takes place a FEW DAYS BEFORE 
the end of the metal age. 

the story:

Since you were involved in Victoria's plot, things are going to be harder for
you. The Mechanists increased their vigilance and you're not so free to go everywhere without taking
careful measures.
Yesterday a man from the Pagans came knocking on your door. When he came in,
you tried to breathe as little as possible because of the smell emanating from him.
"We need your help, Garrett. The Mechanists are going to build a new secret weapon. We don't
know exactly what is it but we know that it will have a deadly effect on everything surrounding
us: woods, air, water...everything could be poisoned by that weapon.
They've created a front to disguise the evil thing and it's called "Gas Station".
Karras fooled the people, telling them it was to bring light and warmth into every house but the truth 
is that this man wants to make slaves of us and destroy all the vegetation.
We must stop this plan. The gas station is the source of many problems and must be destroyed.
We have a plan for you to follow. Remember the promise you made to Victoria...
Find a way to sneak inside the station. Your first objective is to locate the blue shiny node that 
keeps the gas field around the Station up, so do whatever is in your power to get it or destroy it.
If you don't succeed, we risk dying before the assault even begins.
Afterwards, look around to see if there are any other possible dangers to us. When you're sure that everything looks safe, find an exit to the sewer where we will await you. Then we can begin our assault." 

So, on a dark and rainy night your fate will be tied with the destiny of an entire age...

------------------------------
this version was released to fix a couple of final bugs that in the beta stage
we didn’t find and to include the scripts modules used to prevent some
system defaults problems.
Beware: if you don’t like the idea to have a mission pack with the scripts inside BEFORE PLAY, in darkloader press to INSTALL only then go to thief2 folder and delete the files: script.osm thnscript.osm darkhooks.dlx ! after that download from the link down here the scripts modules directly from the original sites.

better setting:
audio: channel 16, hardware acceleration=off, eax=off

Construction *
Base       : From mind
Build Time : A full occupied month (and another month for beta-testing)

NOTE ABOUT THE ANTI-GAS MASK:
in the game you will find a new tool for garrett, it's the AntiGasMask, it works as expected and when you wear it you don't suffer the letal effects of the gas.
Important: to take off the mask you have to select it from your inventory again and click on it. A shortcut key is present, go to the player menu to 
set a Keyboard’s key for select the Antigasmask in a faster way.
Warning: when you wear the mask you cannot use your weapons and if you pick up a weapon, it will disable the Mask.
Same thing if you find a Scouting Orb and use it..
Since you have the mask ON, you can’t eat but you can use the potions.

Extra note about this ‘Gold’ version:
-	A new better model of the Anti-Gas Mask.
-	New explosions at the end.
-	Some minor bug fixing and improved gameplay.

Difficulties differences:
The only two differences between Easy and Med/Expert are the number of the guards and the location of one of the Primal Node keys. 
(obviously except the loot that is 2500 easy, 3500 med, 4500 expert).ù

Sounds:
The music gascel,gaslinder,timrs,timersII and the effects vader,dig1 and dig2 are created by Sterlino with the help of some house tools.
