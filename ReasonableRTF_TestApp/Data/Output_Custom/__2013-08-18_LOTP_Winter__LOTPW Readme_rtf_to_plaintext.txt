Date of Release         : 17 August 2013

Description             : 
Please note that this is not a drastically changed mission and if you’re expecting a “total conversion” with the objectives completely changed then you will be disappointed. (That’s why I didn’t call this something completely different.) Having said that, I believe this has enough of a change to be worth a replay of LOTP. There IS a new objective, but you have to read something to trigger the objective since it’s one that you don’t see when starting a new game. See below for a hint.*


I’ve upped loot requirements for all difficulty levels and added more loot to the game. There’s a lootlist document included in this package if you’re having trouble finding the new loot. I’ve also included a DARK.CFG file to change the font colors of the game menus. You may want to back yours up before installing this mission, but I think your mission loader will do that. In addition, I’ve added little winter themed things like snowballs (which have no functional use; they’re just there for fun) and breath for AIs/Garrett, as well as snowfall. There’s also a fantastic ambient I’m using that Yandros used for his mission A Thief’s Holiday 2004. I’ve also moved around some loot that was already in the mission.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If you’re using NecroBob’s texture pack, please see the IMPORTANT TEXTURE NOTE.txt file in the FAM/CITY directory.

If you’re using NV’s Enhancement Pack 2.0 Alpha, there’s an issue with the moon and how the windows are tiled. I’d recommend just removing the EP and sticking with the necrobob pack, unless you want to try to fix the issue yourself. You’ll need to edit win323.mtl/win323l.mtl with a text editor like notepad++ and change what is in there to terrain_scale 64. In skyhw inside the ep crf, you’ll need to delete the PNG files. This is what I had to do myself to make the windows and the moon look the way they should.

* Loading Information *

Compatible with FMSel and Darkloader 4.3. Put this mission into your fan missions folder in your thief2 folder. Remember to uninstall from darkloader/FMSel if you want to play normal thief 2. Not that you’d do this, but just in case, if switching from FMSel to darkloader I recommend disabling FMSel to be safe. Will not work with T2 1.18. Requires NewDark 1.20 or higher. Not tested with 1.19.

* CREDIT AND SPECIAL THANKS *

- Special thanks to my beta testers: bob_doe_nz, Ravenhook, and Gloria Creep. Thank you for testing my mission! ☺
- Special thanks goes to Yandros for allowing me to "port over" his snowball and snowman models from A Thief's Holiday 2004.

-	Thanks to LarryG and R Soul for helping me with dromed related problems.
-	Thank you to TypeRED for his method of attaching particles to Garrett!
-	Thanks to whoever made the old breath demo for Thief 2. (Sorry, I don’t remember who made it, I don’t have a readme for it.) I used that as a guide to creating the breath for AIs for this winter mission.
-	Thanks/credits to Digital Nightfall et.al for light gem resources from Mission X.
-	The blue health shields I made myself using the default shield as a base, if I recall correctly.
-	Snowpiles I made myself, but the snow texture itself is either from Thief 2 CRFs or Yandros’ mission, I’m not sure which.
-	Thanks to those taffers who created a nice thread for things you should do to your gamesys. (E.g. Like adding LightColor setting to fire arrow archetype in dromed. See thread “Useful changes to your gamesys” over at TTLG.)
-	Schwaa for his ThiefPack.zip and LitCandle.zip
-	PinkDot for his abandoned mission package, klasztor.zip (Took some icicle objects from there)
-	Rob Hicks for the dedx01 package.
-	Targa for his custom bow sights. (custom obj/textures)
-	Purgator for some mesh skins and bin files
-	Thanks to Nameless Voice for his NVScript.osm file.
-	A big thank you to The Watcher for his twscript.osm file.
-	Thank you to R Soul for his custom carry-body models!
-	LarryG for his new, thinner updated blackjack arm/object
-	darthsLair for giving me his new speech.spc/sound files from Thief 3 Deadly Shadows.
-	Includes files from t2skies by Jermi.
- Music credit belongs to Patrick O'Hearn for his beautiful ambient, A Lovely Place to Be from the CD So Flows the Current. (This is the same track used in A Thief’s Holiday.) The loop in this mission is only an excerpt from the track and is therefore much much shorter than the song from the CD. You should be able to find the full track on YouTube. His CD is up for sale on Amazon.

===================================================================================
* Known Bugs *

-	There was a bug specifically at Fieldstone Manor and the bank, but I fixed it by using The Watcher’s custom script twscript.osm. Has to do with the AI breath. To go along with this, there is a small “bug” where if an AI turns a certain way sometimes the breath doesn’t follow his face properly. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of the particle system I’m told and could not be fixed.
-	Any other bugs are probably inherent to the OM, since this is the same mission file. If you find anything obvious, feel free to point it out on the forums.

*Hint: There’s a room in Angelwatch with a papyrus that you must frob. Think of it like Garrett learning about something and it triggers a new objective. (This is a BONUS objective that appears in your objective screen after you use the papyrus.)
