Version 1.1		  : December 2nd, 2012

Description             : This is a Halloween version of Ambush! Beware, there are nasties! There are pumpkins in this level, can you find them all? There is new loot as well. See the “notes.txt” file in the zip for the locations of these items.

Briefing Video          : No, but there are new AVI files for death and success.

Introduction           : I'm meeting Sammy at the Crippled Burrick Pub this evening to talk about merchandise. Tonight's weather seems rather eerie and something doesn't feel right. I've heard stories about paranormal activities during October nights, especially the last day of October. I've never given them much thought since I'm not big on local superstitions.  The word on the street is the local graveyard is ripe with the undead and something could get out. I'm probably being paranoid, but it never hurts to be prepared in case I need to make a quick getaway.

NOTE: I highly recommend installing the Thief 2 Enhancement Pack (if you don’t already have it of course) from Nameless Voice. Thread for the T2 EP is here: http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=118999

Shadows appear to flicker on AI. I’ve had it come and go, so I don’t get what the deal is.

There’s an unnamed arrow Garrett can pick up from a toolbox in a noble’s apartment. It acts like a noise maker arrow (minus the noise.)
