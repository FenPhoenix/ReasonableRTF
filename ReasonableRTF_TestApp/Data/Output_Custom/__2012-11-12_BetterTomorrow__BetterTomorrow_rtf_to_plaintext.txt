* Description *      

ATTENTION : you must have an original and clean installation of the game. Uninstall graphic packs before playing this mission. The mission was designed to be played in black and white, any graphical pack would ruin the experience…

This mission is my entry to the Halloween contest 2012 held on TTLG forums. I tried to propose something a bit different from the usual thief gameplay. The main objective is to survive, nothing else.

As soon as you enter the game, the very first thing to do is to listen to the victrola in front of you for a quick briefing about the situation. Then, it’s up to you…

Known bugs :
-	With Thief 2 V1.19, you may have a few textures left with their original colors. 
-	AIs may randomly end up stuck in places.
-	If you have Thief2.exe V1.19 installed, climbing upon the rooftops is okay. If you are still playing with thief2.exe V1.18, once on the rooftops the game will almost certainly crash due to screen complexity errors.
