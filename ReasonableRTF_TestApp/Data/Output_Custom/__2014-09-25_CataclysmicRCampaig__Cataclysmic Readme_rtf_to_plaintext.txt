(original for Thief) Revision CCR Campain to version 1.2-reason is to be sure that the kill objective of the all seeing eyes produces the eye key.(Salvation)




===================================================================================
1.STORY: The World has changed.  The Earth and it's People are Crying out for answers.  The Keepers usually unseen unless they choose to be seen have placed glyphs throughout
the lands.  The Glyphs not unseen by Garrett, steal his curiosity.  The Hammerites have increased their activities, and for some unknown reasons have established themselves once
again, in the "The Haunted Cathedral"   Now Excorcised, the Hammers have gathered to do "Thy Builders Work"  The Cathedral and it's Shrines, hold memory of Saint Yora, Saint Jenel,
Saint Tennor, and Saint Vale.   The Victorious Saints who continually fight the evil in the World.                     
 
Meteor's and Comet's are frequenting the night skies.  The Moon has turned red ,and rumbles of earthquakes stir great fear into the hearts of men.   Last night at the 
Taffer's Tavern, Fingers the Fingerman spoke a little too loudly, mentioning something about something "suspicious" at the old institution.  Garrett's keen sense drives him further,
as he remembered the nightmare that once existed inside those walls. " Hammers moving back into that place?"  Garrett sets out to find out why the Hammer's have moved back in,
and intends to discover also what the Keepers are doing, and possibly learn what they know.  No time like the present, because there may not be much time left !   And, like always, the
rent must be paid.

******The Story continues now in "The Mission" and the epilogue "Salvation"******

2.Story: "The Mission"
The monastery has been destroyed, and all but a few Hammerites who were abducted by the Trickster's minions  remain alive deep below the earth. All life on th surface of the earth has been wiped out except for 2 Keepers.  The Sun has been layered in dust from the impact of the Asteroid on the earth's surface. Soon an ice age will occur, and the waters of the earth will freeze. The stars and soon the red moon will vanish from sight.  The Inquisitor was slain, and the scrolls dids't vanish once again!  The minions came up from the earth shortly after the impact of the asteroid  to make sure human life was at it's end, and to place 7 guardians to keep the Scrolls of Virtue desolate forever. Soon more shockwaves will come, followed by  a complete devastation of the earth"s surface.  Nuclear winter will follow.

3.Story: "Salvation"
Deep below the earth, a parrell system of caverns was formed made after the Maw.  Being difficult to traverse,the Trickster knew anyone still alive on earth would not be able to reach the abyss of purgatory.  There in the pit of purgatory exists the only human life left on earth.  Garrett must make his way to the bowels of the earth to save a handful of the Builder's Brethren.

4.Story. "Shine on You"  A tribute to the Game and to the Players in the World of Thief.

Warning: Disable EP ( simply rename the epbak.crf, then remove the .bak extension afterwards before playing another fm) Precautions have been made but to be sure!
Playing Info:Some objectives are optional, as the mission is split into 2 separate worlds.  Instead of having to give up because of incomplete objectives, because of it's enormous size, I thought 
it best this way.  The feeling of lonliness is intentional,without alot of material comfort in Version 1.18, but due to some reports, some players thought it wasn't full enough for exploration. So, with about 100 hours of rework, I believe it is improved for experience and game play.

Revision Campaign V1.2 includes:
"The Mission" improved game mechanics, now the player won't have to read the Keeper scroll before the main objective starts. Added a few more readables. Some overall improvements in some objects.
5 videos made with xvid codec 4. Added 1 more mission that lasts only around 1 minute. Resized textures in "Salvation" added one more secret, and enhanced the area. Improved game play, now a little more of a challenge. Fixed Thief gold ambients, so they should all work now.


Videos: You will need Xvid codec to play the videos.  Get them here: download.cnet.com/Xvid-Codec/3000_4-76088742.htm
Without the xvid codec, not being able to view the movies in the game sequence will make the story difficult to understand.

Technical Information: Script used: NvScript.osm  First version has 3 custom made videos: Introduction, Success, and Death. Ending.avi in "Salvation" All .avi movies are made with Divx codec in the Revised edition
V1.2, the past editions, are made with Indeo codec 5.0 or higher.
Known Issues: Framerate may be low in some areas, but a modern machine should handle it with no problems.  Has not been tested on Windows98, or Windows2000.
In part of the second half of the mission the player will have to cycle through the weapons, as some of them cannot be assigned keys or numbers.
This mission is at it's limits, but the pal count is only 151.(Old 1.18)  It is equivalent to 2 Original Missions placed in 1 mission file.  It is huge !  Have fun, as it was made for fun only !
