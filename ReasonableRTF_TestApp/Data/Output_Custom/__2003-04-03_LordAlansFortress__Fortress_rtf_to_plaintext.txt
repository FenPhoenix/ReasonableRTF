Thanks to Scott Murchison for his Garrett’s voice.

A special thanks to Peter Smith who helped me to focus the story.
He has written some good texts to improve it.
He also provided me a lot of really constructive criticism.

download.
I would like to take this opportunity to also thank all the people who sent me feedback and comments about my first mission:
Lord Alan's Basement.
Thanks again to Linda and Peter because their constant interest in this mission helped me to go on with my work.
Just only one word again:
THIEF IS ART
IMPORTANT NOTE: I suggest you play this mission after a fresh boot. Both the complexity of the architecture and the high number of the objects require a lot of memory and powerful cpu (My pc is AMD 1500MHz, 512 RAM, ATI Radeon 8500 64MB).

§ Loading Information §

Use Darkloader version 4.1 or higher.
A fresh boot is recommended before playing the mission.
