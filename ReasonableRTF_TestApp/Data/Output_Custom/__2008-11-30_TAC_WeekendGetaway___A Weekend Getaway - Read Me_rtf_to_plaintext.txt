Title			: A Weekend Getaway

Description		: Thief 2 Fan Mission

Story			: Two years after Basso and Jenivere were married they were planning a romantic getaway for the weekend of their anniversary.  They checked into The Wishing Well Inn, it’s a nice little place on the edge of the city, a little rough around the edges, but the price is right.  Some people say the place is haunted, but Basso says he’s never seen a ghost.  They were hoping for a relaxing weekend, but a little while ago it started to rain, then they started to hear noises.

Bugs & Tips		: You are playing as Basso in this mission, but a nearly as stealthy as Garrett.  This mission uses a unique progression to pack more gameplay into the level.  First you play Part 1 (Normal), then Part 2 (Hard), then Part 3 (Expert).  Some objects are only available to you on certain levels, some books and scrolls can only be read on certain levels.  The AI also changes on each difficulty level as do the goals.  The story will make no sense if played out of order.
