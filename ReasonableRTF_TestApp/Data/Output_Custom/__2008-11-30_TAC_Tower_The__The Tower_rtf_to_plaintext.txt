                                  THE TOWER
 
                  A mission for the 10th Anniversary Contest

        DESCRIPTION

The mission takes place after the events in Thief 2.

"It has come to my knowledge that Lord Witherdale has recently acquired a small but highly valuable collection of ancient jewels. 
The manor is well guarded and almost inaccessible, except from a tower which is connected to the back of the manor. An old guardian still lives in the tower, but it won't be hard to get rid of him or even to sneak through without being seen. I must be careful though. The tower is situated in a small courtyard and strangers are not welcome there, especially at night.
There's not much time left. The guardian will soon be dismissed and the tower will be under restoration. I must act as quickly as possible. Tonight seems just perfect. Time to go!"
