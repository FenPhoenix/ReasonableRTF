Snowball Fight!

Release Date:  2/1/11
Version:  1.0

This mission was made for the Thief Reloaded Contest.
Base Mission:  Life of the Party


Overview
•	There’s no story - you’ve just been challenged to a snowball fight, which takes place in the area of Master Willie’s & Lady van Vernon’s homes.
•	First, select a difficulty to determine how many hits are required to win.
•	Once the mission starts, choose from one to four opponents (whose abilities vary widely), and then frob the door to go outside and let the snowballs fly!
•	Piles of snowballs (5 or 10 snowballs each) can be taken but once; single snowballs will generally respawn every so often.


Known Issues/Notes:
•	Occasionally, the hit percentage will be reported incorrectly, sometimes even with an impossible value (> 100%).  Most of the time, however, it is correct.
•	Sometimes, an AI will fall down to the street.  I’ve designed it so they get teleported back up to a random spot in the play area, so don’t think it’s over if you see them fall!
