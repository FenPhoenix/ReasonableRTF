Description:                                                                                                             
Luckily everything has settled down now. I am glad that I did not get killed in the 
process. Just when I think it’s time to settle down as a rich man with a new name... 
I never did get a penny of Constantine’s one million gold pieces that he had boastfully 
promised, nor the incredible treasures found by the Mechanists. I’ve already 
re-accepted my life of sneaking through town again to earn my living. 
But one morning, fate knocked on my door – in the shape of a unexpected visitor. 
My dagger was ready, but when I opened the door a little, no one was there. I was 
about to return when I noticed a sealed letter on the floor. I looked around for 
someone, again, nobody was there. 

I opened the letter. 

Hm, it seems I have a pen pal now. Not only that, it’s the keeper who put me up when 
I was a child. He is asking for help since he is trapped in some mansion. Well, I should 
be thankful, yet, his sudden request is strange. Absorbed in thoughts, I rumpled the 
paper, collected my tools and went out into town. The market was a good shortcut. 
Big crowds, easy for one to get lost in a sea of people. Too many for the Watch 
to keep an eye on. And then it happened. “Freeze Taffer!” “Don’t move!” 
An ambush. I decided from then on to stay away from ‘merchants’ with knives.

Well, well, well, if it isn’t my old friend Reuben. Apparently, he was fed up with my 
impertinent behaviour and not only made his guys hound me, but also the City Watch 
and the Hammerites. With a little help of my tools I was able to escape. 
A flash bomb and a speed potion were all I needed to get the hell away from there. 
But I knew they would be looking for me, and the streets would be swarming with 
cops. Hiding in some dark corner I was able to rethink Orins letter. I had to 
agree, Lord Duncan’s mansion could not be worse than the streets. Furthermore, 
visiting an estate at daylight is some difference to my habitual night tours.
