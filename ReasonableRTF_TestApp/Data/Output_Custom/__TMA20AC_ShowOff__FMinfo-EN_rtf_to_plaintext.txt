Briefing
"Keep a secret with someone trustworthy,
And it will never see the light of day.
Keep a secret with someone unreliable,
And it will spread like wildfire.
Just as secrets make it easy to prove one's loyalty,
They will just as easily expose you to your adversaries."
- The Encryptors' Book of Meditations

	The nobles of The City are always behaving as if they share a hive mind. No matter which district they live in or how tall the piles of gold they sleep on, they seem to obsess over the exact same fashions and trends. Which dresses to wear, which balls to attend, which cigars to smoke...it's boring enough to lull you to sleep. But now, you have the opportunity to use their latest fad against them.
	About two months ago, reports came in of some unusual gemstones dug up in the western mountains: dark red crystals that appear to have a glowing core. Their color and their jagged shapes earned them the name "crimson shards." And the nobles can't get enough of them. Everyone wants crimson shards set on their necklaces, their bracelets, their tiaras, and whatever else they adorn themselves with. The stonecutters of The City are making a fortune, and if all goes well tonight, so will you.
	On the edge of Hightowne is a fine art gallery called the Furlong Museum, and word has it that the curators have purchased several pieces of jewelry with crimson shards to put on display. Currently, the museum is closed for renovations, no doubt to beef up security for their new exhibit. The guards are certain to be on high alert for jewel-hungry thieves like you, so you've got your work cut out for you. But pull this off, and it'll be you living the high life for a change...

This mission occurs several years after the Thief trilogy.

Author's Notes
-   Higher difficulty settings mean less health, less equipment, a higher loot requirement, and more AI.
-   While the museum gates looked fine to some beta-testers (and myself), others reported they were sized incorrectly. I'm not sure what's causing this.
